"going for a solitary long bike ride to the city of buren following the map and really going against the wind at times but nonetheless managing quite well at a decent speed to reach the beautiful little city and then ride back to culemborg going even faster on the way back avoiding to stop too much to photograph all the interesting countryside animals and architecture"
