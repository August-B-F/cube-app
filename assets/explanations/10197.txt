"in italy during the spring time with the pandemic restrictions being imposed as ome sort of martial law meeting either way people while with my children such as parents keeping in the near of the fountain in schio where i let my kids play all naked like a man from south america and a guy who used to work as a bartender but then got in serious alchool problems and had to walk from thiene to spend some time with her small daughter his mother took away from him due to his issues and also meeting a nice electrician guy i paid to set up electricity in our barn despite having little money and just doing it to host three students from the ied institute in venice who wanted to do a small documentary about my work but soon realizing how much this type institutions are for kids whose parents have a lot of money and not necessarily selecting students because of their talents suddenly trying to distance myself from their sloppy job with the american girl who was a canoe olympic medalist trashing my apartment in venice as a revenge with the complicity of her rich paris friend babysitting the kids of an hyper rich family who bought the villa of the corrupted former prime minister berlusconi and also photographing the guy of the local supermarket in the mountains provoking him saying he should wear a face mask not of the venice republic that enslaved the germanic community in the mountains but rather of the germanic community itself"
