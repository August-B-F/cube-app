"getting quite some dreams affected from all the electronic based prototypes i have built with my japanese friend yoshi and still also dreaming about my director in gothenburg as well as my amaerican curator friend jason while dreaming very much less about my italian family but for one dream crying over my grandfather's dead body i could never mourn on also having quite some poetic dreams in rural landscapes hearing melodies and beside that having quite some frustrated erotic dreams like with women i don't like"
