"hearing now songs heard from livia at school and feeling a bit shocked about the level of brainwashing with many christmas and religious songs being taught despite us not signing up for it and despite her classmates being mostly muslims and also singing songs myself to her and to silvester especially in the afternoon to make life a little jollier especially waiting for their mother to finish working but also hearing the latter singing songs to them mostly from disney cartoons and at last one evening also playing on television an old concert by freddie mercury and his band"
