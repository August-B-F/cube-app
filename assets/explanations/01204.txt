"spending the month working really hard both taking care of my kids as well as my project now setting up a metal workshop in the backyard of our dutch house and beginning the cutting and welding up of the textures for my alpine museum but then getting halted by one neighbour due to the excessive noise and thinking of away to reduce the sound and mostly resuming my normal life working a lot on the editing on my thesis and taking advantage of myrthe's christmas holiday letting her do more of the domestic work i do when she works"
