"making an effort to explore outside of our village despite the lock-down and spending some sunny days in myrthe's brother cabin in the forest taking walks there with the kids trying not to overdo it and also taking a major hike with silvester alone in the backpack walking on the dunes in the near of haarlem but beside for that walking mostly in culemborg and with the sunny weather venturing only once with silvester across the fields now also resuming the welding of the textures in the backyard and going less outside"
