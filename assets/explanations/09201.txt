"quite prolific period managing to take walks alone and in nature despite at times feeling quite tired and also exhausted from all the intense period of wirtings and only while in the town setting not really feeling so free to record my thoughts but generally getting very good insights especially during a walk in the forest in breda while the children kept with myrthe and her father"
