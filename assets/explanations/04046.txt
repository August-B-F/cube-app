"a very emotionally unstable period with the winter darkness setting in and an hopeless feeling not knowing with whom and where my love myrthe goes out and at last being really back in love once again and deciding her to come to live with me making me most happy and also trying then to improve my situation at the university taking bold steps in changing my supervisor for a more competent one and having myrthe coming here too and starting quite low but then getting fully emotional and with a lot of feelings to share"
