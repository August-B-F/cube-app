"a fable conceived in the attic of jacek's father tedeus in krakow while being surrounded by many of his religious figures and crosses and all the still alive religion experienced in churches and monasteries still alive with monks and nuns describing this bird which is orange like the ones i used to experience in north america but then also changes colors picking different new meanings like that of buddhist monk to that of a japanese emperor where he becomes the red sun himself and later refiguring the japanese second war world push towards america and the bomb picked like a mushroom by a god turned to a devil which contrary to the legend require his divine state by falling rather than becoming lucifer and at last the story connects back to the beginning with the crucifixions of his sons angels devils and the use of the crosses as paddles to finally reach the easter island where easter can be unlimited"
