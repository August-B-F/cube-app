"a month having sold my van for very little money now fully concentrated both on the caring of august in the mornings and in the printing of my pictures in the afternoon biking often to the copper graphic workshop in the small island of skeppsholmen despite the winter weather and also making it to the swimming pool quite regularly and only once commuting to gothenburg to teach and beside doing minor home improvements in our tiny stockholm apartment"
