"a pretty clean month with only few exposures to traffic mostly in stockholm working on my thesis and my project waiting for the winter to go by but also building plywood crates for my photo panel sawing them and breathing the glue inside and working in sunny days mixing mortar outside breathing the cement and then in sweden to play with august cutting accidentally a fiberglass tube smelling all the chemical and breathing the fresh paint while renovating a small room for him in the netherlands as well as experiencing the rotterdam traffic in a one day visit to the art fair"
