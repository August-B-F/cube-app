"time spent in bigger cities like berlin finding it particularly clean with some traffic but a bit more suffocating being back in the southern suburb of stockholm with a still air and again the nearby truck factory and the highway but then also going back to my parents in northern italy and finding there even more polluted air with many cars and congestion around the old city center to finally going to visit my girlfriend in the netherlands and again find a rather clean air with moderate traffic outside of the pedestrian city center where anyway there are predominantly bikers"
