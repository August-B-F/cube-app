"describing how i gave up chemical and switched to more natural materials painting in a natural setting not so much as an artist but more as a shaman finally understand the danger of pursuing one's own talent in an industrialized context bringing now nature itself as my set of constraints however having to think all my artistic practice upon moving to vancouver where my art became synonymous with my survival as well as with the spontaneous sharing of my learning to become autonomous especially with homeless people finally however leaving the city to move to the swedish countryside to really try out to be self-sufficient but there having no more the luxury to paint but the cabins of the farm and in a most monotonous and traditional way which has come to reflect my more recent paintings"
