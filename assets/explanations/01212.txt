"working very hard at the beginning of the month being left alone in italy after a fight with myrthe and taking advantage of the situation to do all the work i was not able to do with the kids starting to plaster the barn in the mountains and spending a few days cleaning up the path to the project museum before finishing to freshen up the venice apartment yet never managing to take many picture despite all the work using in fact little objects and also using little objects returning to the netherlands mostly focusing on the children and doing promotion of the project museum on the internet"
