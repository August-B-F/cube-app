"still in krakow meeting up with jacek's friend while he was already gone and going out mostly in the evening in bars talking to them about the hobbies they have to leave aside such as music but also meeting a very nice short girl who was also a musician and sang from her room while i was trying to organize an exhibition which brought me to talk to a curator of a new institute and then on my way back to sweden at night meeting an indian student very afraid of me since i walked to the road to the city center and later meeting a swedish italian nice guy studying old history after which i met a finn swedish at an opening with quite a lot of vitality and with whom we tried to do some exhibition again but never managed and at last meeting a cool colleague of jacek from manchester with a lot of nice stories and quite nice political opinions revealing me many insights of old england"
