"taking a break from all the routine of taking care of my children and work going to italy for the spring holidays having at time the possibility to walk alone up to the project museum to finish attaching the tags on the last floor and recording in general a few thoughts on these occasions despite feeling rather dizzy from all the gluing and the glue itself and also when walking with my family at times keeping a bit on the distance to record a compelling thought but never managing to find the total peace of mind to really think through it"
