"stressing once again the fact that i do not paint as part of a tradition but that my main role is that of a conceptual artist who is still in the middle of a performance and this performance implies me having to conduct a simple life and not that of an artist therefore also painting as i would actually paint without having to play a more sophisticated role and detach myself from my reality to try to reach the bubble of the art world i will probably reach only after i finish my project and i am old and i can claim to have pushed for a concept no other artists have ever dared to push for especially because it entails becoming a no one"
