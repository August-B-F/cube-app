"a quite unstable period having to reset continuously to different realities feeling rather down probably based on the distance from my kid maybe emotionally accentuated by a lot of love making with my love myrthe but mostly feeling rather depressed by academia having attended a conference in england with too much politics and having to regain my integrity by walking a lot in the beautiful countryside finding back my soul and so also with myrthe having idyllic bike ride in the woods and gaining much happiness and finally again feeling quite down when adjusting with my parents in the italian seaside but then getting happy again with myrthe and august on my side finding nice things to do in a wild beach like fishing crabs and building shelter despite the bad reactions of liselott since i did not manage to provide her a regular update on august due to the scarcity of internet connection"
