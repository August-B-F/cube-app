"a period working full time as a carpenter and really struggling to collect trash often going to work for museums in amsterdam or other parts of the netherlands and walking outside during my break finding occasional trash and hiding it in my jacket but also trying to take my kids out for walks during my free time finding not so much trash in general also due to the winter period and much rain with just some trash linked to the festivities also however quite limited due to the corona virus pandemic restrictions"
