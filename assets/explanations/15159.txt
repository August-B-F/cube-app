"breathing an okay air in the mountains but then going to venice enjoying our apartment there for the last time and often taking the ferry to go with the children around the city trying to be in the back to avoid wearing the mandatory mask to curb the pandemic but breathing quite a lot of exhaustion from the old ferry and also traveling with the kids back to the netherlands finding a most awful pollution in milan with months of no rain and a yellow sky in the end crossing the alps and finding a much cleaner air but still quite some traffic even in our village especially when going around the industrial part of it to look for a less polluting car"
