"a day started in the states doing some domestic work at panagiotis apartment in cambridge like cooking and laundry but mostly being on the road and in fact being quite homey in jason's apartment in brooklin to then go back to sweden and doing much cleaning work in the house before myrthe's first visit to stockholm and really almost not photographing and doing barely nothing to photograph with her august around but just taking a sort of a sabbath and enjoying our love together to then teach a few classes with a lot of electronic stuff show to three groups of students and regaining my active mood with drawings but also much cleaning in liselott apartment before coming to visit myrthe again in utrecht and taking it super easy after a period of stress"
