"traveling a new route down the belgian ardenne after dropping my girlfriend younger brother to fetch his car there and ending up in middle of the remembrance of a great battle with mostly belgian folk dressing up like american troops and a few dressing like nazis and getting to chat with some in the actual big monument commemorating the event and later driving south and stopping in the beautiful city of strasbourg and exploring it despite the recent terrorist attack there and meeting some bumps dressing up like santas or playing christmas songs before making it to italy and meeting there the super muscular boyfriend of my step sister and some people in the sunny and nice villages south of the garda lake where we awaited for august arrival"
