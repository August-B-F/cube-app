"a month spent entirely in the netherlands now focusing almost exclusively on livia having less time for my project despite also being able to collaborate with the architect in italy for the building of the aedicule and going by bike a few times and also doing some little home improvement like welding a closet but other than that just mostly keeping home with the bad november weather"
