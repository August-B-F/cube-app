"some sunny days to begin with especially while working on my metal workshop in the backyard and despite the cold nights always having quite some heat during the day but then getting a period of rain forcing me and the kids at home before a few days of very cold weather followed by a spring weather with even flowers on the ground yet soon replaced by a harsh week with a lot of snow and the water freezing and people suddenly going out to ice-skate spending myself a lot of time out with the kids going with the sled despite them getting quite cold especially in the morning"
