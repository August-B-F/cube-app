"some time spent at the seaside alone with all of my kids and feeling at times frustrated unable to even swim in the sea with the small ones always at my side but also having a good time walking with them and even biking before rebelling against my mother and sisters always looking down on us and telling them to fuck off in the end feeling happy to be back in the mountains taking small walks with the kids before resuming the building of my museum there and feeling afraid at first to work high up on the last floor but then finding a good way to do so only having issues with myrthe too work oriented and stressed but soon getting better at last only getting really affected by the many hunters coming by to join arms against my museum"
