"a quite regular period of running with little traveling and also the snow out which at first made me continue running in my little park going twice diagonally to it in order to accomplish my usual lap hurrying up at times to go to meetings but then having to switch to the parking lot with the melting of the snow and running there a few times despite the traffic pollution and the hard asphalt not good for my knees but lastly finding the snow completely melted and running again in the park this time only having to pay attention to the dog poo and keeping up good tempo"
