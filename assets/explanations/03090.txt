"singing to myrthe driving up to the mountains and recording the titles with mental images and listening to music at giancarlo's restaurant while working on the internet before taking a short trip to stockholm to fix up my unemployment rights and hearing music at the airport before going back to the mountains singing with gianna but also composing new songs for the musical sheet and spending time in the car to view a tractor listening to quite some radio and writing down the song on paper while driving"
