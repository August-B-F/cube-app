"a lot of walking with the good weather biking to places and taking small walks like in a weekend with august and my old norwegian colleague asmund but then being quite blocked due to again an inflammation of my plantar fascia on my right foot and finding slowly a way to walk again by taping up my foot to support walking and talking rather extensive walks with myrthe in utrecht and amsterdam to then also walk a lot myself from nykoping to the airport and in berlin with myrthe again from the south to the north of the city but also all alone to the american spy tower station in and across the woods to some rich neighborhood and then again in tiergarten like this past winter but also taking a quite large walk in potsdam feeling really good and free of roaming from dusk to dawn trying to recover my sanity after all the brainwashing i get from work"
