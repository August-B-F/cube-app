"with my family now leaving for sweden being left alone in cambridge with my old friend alessandro and quitting my job to go with him first up north to visit my father for the last time in montreal and then going around the beautiful ontario lake stopping in toronto and the across the very decadent upper state new york lastly returning to cambridge and soon flying also back to sweden and there directing myself immediately to the countryside to reunite with my son and revive a bit of the swedish life like pruning the old apple trees"
