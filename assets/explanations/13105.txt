"filming public space during a beautiful autumn in sweden really much enjoying my son's rich neighborhood and also exploring the netherlands following myrthe to arnhem and taking an exploring extensively there despite the cold weather to then go back again to a sunny sweden and later to italy for a very sunny christmas vacations keeping mostly in the alps and at last reaching sweden again finding a frozen landscape and hard to film with my hands freezing"
