"getting ready right after waking up to print another round of tags but being unable to turn on the machine having pressed the start button instead of the power button the last time i try to turn it off and in the end managing but forgetting to turn on the fan causing a disruption of the print due to the fumes and having tobprint twice over the same batchyet with not such visible difference."
