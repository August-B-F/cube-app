"a month started with italian bad weather particularly in venice with rain and exceptional high water yet still quite warm and in fact finding a beautiful solar weather in santa caterina nearby my native highland where i bought a little place to then come to sweden and find an awful bad weather but also some sun but very short days before moving back to the longer days of the netherlands however finding the temperature much more unbearable with the cold humidity and only one day of sun"
