"at first exploring the beautiful city of leiden extensively filming all its public places but then being stopped to visit public space because of the constant rain here in holland but also the work dedicated to present my cathedral idea to the italian municipality and commuting for an entire week to utrecht to build a 3d model of the cathedral filming public spaces in my walk from the station to the shop and filming while in culemborg on my way to do grocery and other everyday tasks"
