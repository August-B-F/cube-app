"a rather clean air in our dutch village but in the southern part experiencing quite some traffic especially during days of no wind taking for example the family for a walk to the city farm and also facing some traffic driving around looking for a van going west and east of the country and even with up north to the far less inhabited frisland breathing more of a fresh and scandinavian like air there later with some sunny days focusing very much in our garden building a little wooden house for the children and doing a lot of other small improvements in the open only a few times using the angle grinder to cut old screws making a bit of dust"
