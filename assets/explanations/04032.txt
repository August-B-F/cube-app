"a period pierced by strong sadness, first in denmark after presenting my work and feeling rather misunderstood and then with my kid celebrating christmas alone prior departing from one another but then some good time spent with jacek hiking up the dolomites with thrill of being sucked in an avalanche which gave us much to talk about and was really invigorating and then home at my parents in the alps feeling rather okay but sometime a bit oppressed by the family environment spiced up by joyous relatives' dinners"
