"initially taking a bit of excursions with the kids going to the dunes by the sea and also being very active exploring the surrounding but then getting some bad weather again with snow and also receiving the shipment of metal pieces spending much time welding in the backyard and basically visiting new places more in combination with supplies i needed to keep up with the welding such as driving with silvester on the other side of the river to get a gas tank and exploring the forest there or driving to get welding wire and checking out more nature in the surrounding and beside for that mostly keeping in our small dutch village filming the usual public places there"
