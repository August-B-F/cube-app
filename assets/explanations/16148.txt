"a period of almost non stop sunshine with a cold wind to begin with but then getting increasingly warmer and summerish to the point that i spent several days with the kids by the river and at a newly discovered beach in a former mining site getting even a sunstroke during a picnic and finding it way too hot avoiding later to go out in the middle of the day yet enjoying the weather especially in our garden where we kept also a lot given the coronavirus pandemic lock-down andthe good weather bringing a lot of people to break the distancing rules particularly by the river"
