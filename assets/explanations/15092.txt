"a month started in stockholm being in the city with quite some traffic and also traveling there with the plane and back in the netherlands driving down through germany and mostly experiencing much pollution in italy trying to go from lago di como to bergamo taking smaller roads and at last being in venice only breathing a bit of pollution rowing with my stepfather in the gran canale and beside that breathing the good mountain air while working in the mountains and a bit of smoke from the stove and some of the chainsaw emissions"
