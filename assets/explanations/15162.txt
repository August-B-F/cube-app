"a month spent fully in the nethelrands with some level of pollution experienced the few times i visited cities like scheveningen but in general keeping rather at home with my kids and also their mother being sick and there off an on mixing quite some many bags of concrete to finish the long garden pathway i made using old bricks and protecting myself from the thin cement but at times getting it on my working clothes also later catting the metal pieces from the previous sheds but other than that especially with a rainy weather coming not really getting exposed pollution beside for a few times activating the laser machine in the attic to produce the project museum tags and forgetting to turn on the aspirator getting the room full of a sour smell"
