"a lot of time spent out now with the coming of the spring and much more wind rising with the changing of temperatures in stockholm, amsterdam with myrthe and in boston where the long walking got me very exposed although the days of very strong wind were just a few particularly out on mount auburn cemetery from the top of the tower overlooking the boston area but also at my departure walking with the trolley to the subway and less so with the artificial wind created between the downtown blocks"
