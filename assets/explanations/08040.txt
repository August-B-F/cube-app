"a story written while on a nice week vacation with my kid alone going to bed with him and writing on this louse which as spread in his school but also being affected by playing with the snow with my kid and his black little friend and a penitentiary i found walking on the other side of the river but much of the dandruff i also get in my hairs using an expensive shampoo at the gym at work which also might indicate a reawake of my libido now with the spring after a period of solitude and hibernation"
