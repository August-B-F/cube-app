"talking about my exhibits in rather important museum around the world but how soon it became pointless to exhibit more with the height of the wall of these museums being too low and either way feeling disappointed about only showing one of my works thus becoming some sort of nice package for curators to use finally opting to build my own museum with all my works but by doing so losing whole my reputation"
