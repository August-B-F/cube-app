"beginning this lecture considering how the making of the project museum helped me to shape my project further but how as a building as such it has no possibility to function with all the impure sources going against it and further on now discussing how i am anyway bound to my work as a carpenter in holland and describing my experience working for the biggest museums in the country building but also demolishing exhibitions wasting hundreds of cubic meters of wood when celebrated artists could just build their own museum as i did with no further waste but also understanding the commercial interest about circulating a collection and how this interest suffocates the work of emerging artists and a new culture also criticizing all the postcolonial content on display on the very pedestals i build just looking further to the new threats that should be discussed such as the expansions of china in asia but also africa and in africa discussing the cave paintings of the san people as depicting not celebrities but the daily survival as i am also doing with my work especially now that i am fully invisible and anonymous"
