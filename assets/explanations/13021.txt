"still commuting a lot from the south to the north of shanghai to finish off my teaching at the university there with the city getting really in a feverish preparation for the expo with new boulevards being built but finding shelter with my son very often keeping in the parks and the jing'an temple not too far from us later giving up also my university teaching all together and assisting my swedish wife in her ethnographic studies going much around the parks to connect with old chinese people performing in various fashions and interviewing them"
