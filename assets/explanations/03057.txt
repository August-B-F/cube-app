"songs heard again while training and then also in berlin at the radio in the hostel while having breakfast and at home at my parents and some also for the first time in utrecht played with myrthe at her brother house not to mention that i have also started to be aware of these songs that i spontaneously sing almost involuntary thus treating the subconscious as not me but someone else singing although this process of distanciation can be tricky"
