"in the netherlands now taking full care of livia and enjoying the weather still rather warm with myrthe highly pregnant and still working but then finally taking maternity leave and doing quite some work now moving my study in the attic and turning my study into a bedroom for our future son doing quite some painting and fixing also around the house but also taking advantage of the weather to go on my racing bike and beside that mostly using objects to cook for both myrthe and little livia"
