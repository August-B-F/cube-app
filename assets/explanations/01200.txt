"a month spent still partly in the mountains finishing off the building of the structure of my museum there and then cleaning up but also starting to spend more days with my family until at last leaving to go back to holland and there recovering my more motherly tasks like cooking and taking care of the children but also working to improve the shed where i am planning to produce the time capsules for the museum"
