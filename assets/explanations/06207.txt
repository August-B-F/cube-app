"heart beats recorded in my last period at work also biking there with myrthe's electric bike but finishing the battery and having to pedal back and also dismantling another heavy exhibit in utrecht before calling it off and just keeping home doing a bit of work setting up plaster boards in the attic and dismantling the metal workshop in the garden but for some time not really doing any physical exercise despite biking the kids to school prior traveling with them to the italian alps and fatiguing trying to search for a place where to build my cathedral there having to carry them even both in my shoulders"
