"a month spent fully at work yet still registering the weather making it outside during the breaks both at the workshop but also while installing and dismantling exhibitions in apeldoorn and then for a whole week in amsterdam taking longer walks there in open spaces and getting to feel the autumn wind with the leaves blowing out of the trees and only one night experiencing major storm with a lot of wind and despite that experiencing a rather mild wind mostly also during the weekend trying to be as much outside as possible with my kids"
