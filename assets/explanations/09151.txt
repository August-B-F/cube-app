"finally able to get some good thoughts out with some time to think about them and feeling very prolific in my head often having thoughts after my walks while at home and trying to remember to record them later walking mostly alone with silvester with livia at school and with livia while silvester takes his afternoon nap and enjoying with the kids the snow while also making my reflections feeling that i have reached somehow a level of wisdom despite being completely isolated and with no audience but perhaps the future visitors of my museum in the alps"
