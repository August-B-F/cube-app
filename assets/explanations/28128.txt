"checking out some insects while in italy and then venturing to check some properties for sale closer to my native highland exploring both some cimbrian ruins in the agno valley and then making it to the tretto highland falling very much in love with the nature there walking below the branzome with some snow and even water pouring down the forest in the end going back to sweden and dismantling my whole show room there so as to rent out my apartment and have enought money to buy a land where to build a bigger exhibit"
