"quite a summerish month started with a beautiful sun biking all the way to the department summer conference in the perfectly blue sky and also getting a nice weather with august during the boyscout camping in an island to latter experience a cold and cloudy weather and finally a nice summer heat attending a music festival in the netherlands and a colder and a bit rainy weather later coming back to utrecht which got me a bit depressed till i was able to bike outwith more sunny but still cloudy weather and at last experiencing a fully sunny weather canoeing with myrthe in a national park"
