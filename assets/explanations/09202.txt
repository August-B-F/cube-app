"still in a frenzy writing very much about my project now that both my children are at school but for the sake of sleeping better also taking walks especially by the river recording my thoughts there and elaborating mostly on my anarchist readings and writings also at times walking with the children and recording the thoughts that naturally pop up in my head despite also a strong wind making it hard to record later however losing a bit of my prolific state going more into solving technical issues related to my website"
