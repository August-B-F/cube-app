"starting the running section now in utrecht at a nice little oval park outside the historical center but feeling low energy and resuming running only back in sweden also with myrthe at my place and following me to the park but then getting a stiff back and resuming my running with some pain also forgetting to speed up at last at my sixth lap but otherwise feeling physically rather good with regular training at the gym"
