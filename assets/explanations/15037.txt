"a pretty clean air month spent mostly in sweden with the bad weather keeping me and my friend davide mostly inside but then also very clean air in warmer netherlands with myrthe and much more polluted air in boston where i got to a conference and to take some time off walking a lot and thus being very exposed to the much traffic and gasses particularly when walking along the charles river mostly by congestions of new cars"
