"quite a lot of walking to begin with following my stepfather in venice and getting quite disoriented of all is intricate paths but then finally feeling more oriented walking alone and later doing a lot of small walks to check different lands to buy shortly next to iseo lake finding the terrain to steep and then north west of my parents city of vicenza where all my ancestors are approximately from and also doing a bit of walking in vicenza itself and brescia waiting for the airport bus to take me back to sweden where i did some walking with august despite the weather but also a bit walking in the netherlands and particularly in utrecht going up and down to different print shops to prepare a show for dublin"
