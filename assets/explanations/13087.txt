"filming of public spaces started in utrecht with the spring starting to really and shine and allowing me to spend quite some time outside fascinated with the many different historical sites of the city of utrecht but also shortly going to malmo and documenting some of the modern and cold places there to then move back to stockholm and filming there with the nice weather going around with little august during the many spring holidays when we also camped out and also shortly back in italy exploring the hills where i was painting in my young years and falling in love with them and the mountain landscape in the background"
