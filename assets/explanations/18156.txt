"a quite unstable period with a lot of wind to begin with and then some days without any wind with later however a winter storm setting in and bringing quite some snow and wind making it almost impossible to go out to enjoy the landscape with little silvester getting quite frozen but at last managing to go out and play in the snow and on the ice only with the sun and little wind"
