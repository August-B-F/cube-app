"walking not so intensively but mostly in already two occasions with the stroller first in italy with my nephew and my twin sister to the park and then with myrthe around utrecht and a bit more in the suburbs by the water and despite that walking in the city with first jacek going from the south part of town to the center where he lives or walking around the river through a castle but nothing really too long feeling still a bit of pain in my knee and getting special shoes for it back in italy where i have been walking in the fields around a small town while waiting for them"
