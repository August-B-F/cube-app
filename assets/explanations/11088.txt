"still some trash picked during my christmas holiday in italy like during a nice visit with myrthe to the beautiful city of verona but mostly trash collected walking in sweden both in sotertalje and in stockholm where some snow has also fallen making the sidewalk really dirty and latter trash collected in the southern city of malmo that had no snow but a lot of wind throwing all the trash around and collecting there quite much trash during my exploration of the little and gray city"
