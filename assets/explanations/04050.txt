"a period feeling rather burnt out but then finding back my focus with sunny days biking and feeling bad again with myrthe now deciding not to come over this fall and then getting much of a winter weather once again till at last feeling very good about biking out with august to the countryside despite a fight with a camping site owner and gaining much happiness to finally be allowed by my new supervisor to move on with my project in a more experimental way"
