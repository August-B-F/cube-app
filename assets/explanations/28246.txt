"a month spent in the mountains filming mostly the finishing of the project museum there setting up the textures on the last floor with august feeling quite confident about our technique but also filming some observing of clouds and later the oiling of the museum and experimenting with the zoom filming the marmots we found in a walk with my german artist friend florian and his daughters before filming the cutting of small trees and fixing of the path to the museum in the mist of a heatwave left completely alone in the mountains"
