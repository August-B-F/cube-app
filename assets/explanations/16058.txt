"a month in which i experienced all sorts of weather like the gloomy and not too cold of sweden to then travel with myrthe to the alps and also there find that the winter has not started expecting a lot of snow at my parents' place at last getting so much rain that it went through the ceiling but then moving to the foot of the mountain and experiencing most sunny days in verona and latter the most gorgeous winter day in the island of the iseo lake with very good visibility of the alps and also a sunny day walking in the mountains to then get again rain and move back to the gloomy cloudiness of sweden but at last experiencing a sudden turn with a cold but sunny winter setting in with finally snow making the landscape very inviting and nice"
