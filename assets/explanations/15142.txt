"a winter month spent in total lock-down due to the pandemic and breathing good air with little traffic when walking around the city but also doing quite some welding of the textures of my museum and going with my head too much on top of the welding gun inhaling some fumes and finally deciding to build a whole new shed to decrease the noise i make cutting metal but also make a new table for the welding so that i don't have to lean over the fumes and can extract them but then also getting a free stock of discarded isolation panels to put inside the shed and breathing the dust and the smell cutting and arranging them inside"
