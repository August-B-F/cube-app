"a month leaving the hard physical labour of the mountains switching completely to the more domestic life in the netherlands where i had to replace the camera after malfunctioning getting lighter pictures in the new one and working hard on my project and consistently doing plastering and painting of the walls in myrthe's house also having some days away from the house with little pictures taken going for a bike ride or towards the end staying in a shop in utrecht to print a model of my cathedral"
