"another tough month with a lot of snow doing much cooking and small tasks in our old and noisy uppsala apartment in sweden making it still around by bike particularly to reach the train station and commute to the capital to teach mostly electronics to my art and design students but also in the middle of the month making it to the countryside to start pruning the apple trees despite the cold temperature and beside that going a bit to swim despite my back and my sleepless nights made worst by the frequent commuting and the winter not willing to let go but feeling a bit better getting visited by my russian friend pyotr and his austrian buddy and with them spending a few days hiking in the city natural reserve still with quite some snow and objects related to forest survival as i always liked such as knives and matches to get the fire going"
