"a month started with walking quite a lot while in sweden taking advantage of the nice winter weather and crossing back and forth the rich neighborhood of my kid and later taking smaller walks while in the netherlands exploring the river next our house and on a gray day in utrecht waiting to get on a plane and walking with august several times prior christmas despite him not being so happy about crossing stockholm and at last going to the italian alps doing mostly work in my new field and not so much walking"
