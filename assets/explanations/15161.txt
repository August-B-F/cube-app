"quite a month with at first increasing pollution perceived in our dutch town with far more traffic than i can remember especially crossing the railroad over the industrial area where i have been trying to get material to keep up with the building of the pathway in our garden and here also mixing the concrete by hand and trying not to get myself to much exposed by it and even in the free days breathing some not so nice air like at the habour getting some sweds to meet up with the boats there making quite a pollution and then cutting metal to prepare myself to drive to italy finding quite some clean air stopping in the black forest but then having to go though the milan area feeling as if in a nightmare of traffic and pollution and bad infrastructure almost as if in india at last reaching the mountains and breathing quite some good airr there despite all the cutting of grass but using a good gasoline for it yet not so good when cutting trees for my friends francesco and my new artist friend nero using the chainsaw later however breathing good air just showing the project museum to students and traveling back to the netherlands directly via the tyrol"
