"working very hard at the beginning finishing the welding of the project museum textures with myrthe on holiday and often worrying about taking too many pictures but in the end never exceeding the limit of the format i gave myself and later taking far less pictures with the welding job down still producing every week a new batch of mosaics but generally taking little photos especially in the days going with the kids for excursions but also alone to amsterdam to join the protest against the bombing of gaza and later to delft to check a land art foundation where to possibly install my mosaics combining it with trips to rotterdam and in these occasions not really using so many tools other than my phone and my camera having also lost my pocket knife while back at home using quite many utensils to cook for the kids and clean after them"
