"very much in utrecht in the attic of my girlfriend myrthe listening a bit to her favorite songs like an american little known band but also hearing quite much the music played out in the city like for instance by the big belfry of the cathedral that started paying for more than an hour pop italian songs or on the streets from choirs and old music machines but also music heard on a trip with myrthe to madrid"
