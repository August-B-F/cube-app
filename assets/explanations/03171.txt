"still alone with the kids in italy listening very often to music driving up and down the mountains to do grocery or for other errands and with silvester often wanting the same italian oldies but also putting at times some nice english songs for livia and at times also streaming it from the web and listening to songs also at a concert we ended up in a nice outdoor place in the middle of the ripened fields eating watermelon there with the kids and recognizing quite some songs being played later stopping at the seaside in jesolo to say hi to my old friend francesco and his family hearing a lot of songs also there played live in their hotel but also broadcasted on the streets later picking myrthe up from the airport and making it down south to abruzzo listening to more songs in the car also on the way to rome to pick august from the airport there and in the city strolling around with him"
