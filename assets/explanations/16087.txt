"weather characterized by a way too warm temperature both in the netherlands and in sweden but not so much in italy finding quite cold and humid nights in my highland but feeling a very nice and sunny in our mountain cottage eating outside and working with tshirt overlooking all the clouds and smog of the flatland where it did not rain for more than two months until it started snowing and finding also snow and a very cold weather on my way back to sweden with nonetheless bright days"
