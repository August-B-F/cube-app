"finally quitting for good my low-paid job as a carpenter and getting back my creative mind especially hanging out all day with the kids and exploring our small reality making jokes and free associations with them and getting more ideas or just getting ideas finally left alone in the evening to draw at times feeling too tired and frustrated to do so but always in the end enjoying that moment of the day"
