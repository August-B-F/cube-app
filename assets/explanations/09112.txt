"having little time to walk around alone now with baby silvester and livia to take care of basically making it a point to record my thoughts taking small walks to the supermarket or the hardware store always quite careful not to be heard and at times also recording my thoughts walking with myrthe ahead of me and pushing livia or silvester asleep in their strollers"
