"doing a lot of hard labour at work especially dismantling a big post-colonial exhibition at the stedelijk museum and working as a slave tossing hundreds of almost new heavy panels in the trash container later in my short christmas holiday emptying the attic and fixing it doing quite some work carrying all the plaster boards there to place them around the new window and on the ceiling and back to work using myrthe's electric bike for the first time to go all the way there and back several times doing quite some training especially pedaling on the dike down the stream in the dark and with a freezing temperature"
