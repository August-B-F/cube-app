"trash collected from the beginning in the netherlands with the euphoria of the world cup rising and a lot of national support around utrecht where i have been walking picking some trash also picking some in dordrecht on my way to a national park and finally going to italy with both myrthe and august and picking trash on a sidewalk along the sea or in the main city center finding trash from pizzerias and ice-cream places but not so much from discos as i had expected"
