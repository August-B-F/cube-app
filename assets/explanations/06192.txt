"beside biking livia to her little friend tom doing a lot of exercise setting up a whole new shed to try to make less noise when cutting metal and really sweating hard having to put it up all by myself and with the recycled material i got mostly from our neighbours who are renovating the house across the street but also going at night to pick material from a container in front of a shop closing down due to the pandemic and reaching a peak of fatigue having to lift and put the ceiling all by myself"
