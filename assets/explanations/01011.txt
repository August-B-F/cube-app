"still in sweden photographing the usual objects both while in stockholm cooking and doing computer work but also while in gothenburg teaching my international students and in the weekend always making it to our uppsala farm to keep up renovating but also taking advantage of the not so cold weather to still plant dome apple trees before setting off a long journey by car to italy to sell my car and get a van with the help of my parents who managed to sold my old one and staying in italy trying also to keep as much as possible with my grandfather using several tools to go in and out the many doors of his and my mother's apartment but also managing to go for a swim there and then really upsetting my mother having turned down an offer from my uncle to work for his factory and promptly leaving with the new van to sweden to get back to the countryside and my work as well as my morning working with the updating of my project characterized by many computer mouses"
