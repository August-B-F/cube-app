"a strong wind to begin with in the mountains even waking me up in the middle of the night with the entrance door opening but later settling and also spending time in venice really enjoying the weather there with always some wind getting rid of the heat and later traveling to milan and back in the mountains always experiencing little wind until almost no wind and a lot of heat"
