"a very sunny month spent in sweden being quite regular to begin with swimming but also taking many walks in stockholm with also my russian friend pyotr and a lot with my small son august also biking with him but generally playing quite much together with all his toys and spending some time in the countryside at first pruning the apple trees and later even beginning to cultivate my vegetable garden and in between making it to the other side of sweden in gothenburg to teach not really taking many pictures then"
