"again very little time spent in the attic with myrthe now taking it over during the day due to the coronavirus lock-down forcing her to work from home and mostly spending the dark hours there also adding a panel on the only window to protect us from the strong sun and having little light to paint but anyway managing to complete one painting feeling rather bored during the weekend with both kids and myrthe asleep"
