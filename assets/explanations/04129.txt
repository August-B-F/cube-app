" a lovely period spent in the netherlands with my small kids and withe specially livia growing into a cute little girl only feeling rather frustrated on how to go about with my textures for the tebah and thinking constantly about it until at last getting a cold shower from the architect saying that the schio municipality wants me now to get all sort of expensive expertise for the tebah making myself totally poor yet to some extent also happy to be able to focus exclusively on my kids and the content of my work while up north"
