"a month experiencing a full lock-down in our little dutch town due to the coronavirus outbreak but still being able to take the kids out especially with the nice weather and despite the limited options often making it to different places also discovering a nice pond by the river and filming the natural settings and not so often keeping in the city avoiding people there and keeping the safe distance to contain the spread of the virus"
