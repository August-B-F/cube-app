"breathing some quite clean air in the netherlands spending much time outside and only encountering some traffic going south of our village and also at times traveling to other towns like around the small city of gorinchem later also going to provence and breathing quite some good air in the nature but always experiencing heavy traffic and congestions next to all the towns we visited despite provence being advertised as the less polluted place in the whole of france"
