"finally back in sweden after a coldish and rainish summer in the netherlands and then in italy and finding the weather unusually warm and super nice but then experiencing it getting much cloudier with occasional thunder and at last the rain coming right at myrtle's arrival but then also again some nice days of sun in which we went out at the beach behind the harbor and could even swim until it got too cold and at last it started to be quite cloudy feeling however quite warm in the last days whenever the sun shone"
