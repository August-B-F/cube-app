"in italy for the winter holiday taking many walks with my family but unable to record my thoughts being always with them and back in holland with the landscape getting suddenly frozen and covered with ice and snow taking several long walks out in the most remote nature at times just feeling too cold to cold in my hands to even hold my phone but managing to get some thinking back in my head"
