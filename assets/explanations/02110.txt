"pretty good nights of sleep in my new apartment living alone now after the traveling down south which has still particularly a repercussion with all the german and polish cities and environments i dream of but also dreaming about my family and my native environment which i also recently visited not to mention that this very environment where i now live is also quite affecting me with all the immigrants and my fear of bringing my kid here nonetheless also dreaming of some new girlfriend or a new pretty and young girl to kiss aside from some ugly one which i make love to with much hesitation"
