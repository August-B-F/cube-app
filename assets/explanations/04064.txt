"an overwhelming start of the month with a lot of journalists contacting me while up in the mountains making my heart somewhat close and a bit preoccupying myrthe visiting me but then feeling happy again planning my show-room in the alps although also getting quite dark overworking with a shelf I wanted to put instead of the big bed and then going to the netherlands and feeling good despite getting back pain after running and then at last having a very nice sunny weekend with myrthe walking randomly around"
