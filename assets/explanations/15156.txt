"making quite an effort to breath good air at work often keeping the garage door open while cutting panels yet still getting to breath dust even in the new space with a lot of machines not working properly and getting worry about my lungs but finally going into the very short christmas holiday and cleaning up the dusty attic building a new set up there keeping however the windows open and several days going for walks avoiding to cut wood or the many plaster boards i started placing on the walls and ceilings inhaling good and fresh air during my walks especially with the children"
