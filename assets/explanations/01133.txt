"a month started in my new cottage in the mountains doing a bit of fixing but also a lot of walking in the sun and mostly taking care of the lighting of the fire and later going shortly to sweden in my new little room but getting things working rather functionally doing activities in either my little room or the kitchen o the bathroom but feeling rather nervous in such a small environment with also little august and the snow out forcing us to keep inside but anyway managing later to go to the netherlands and spend a whole week not only on my thesis but also building a prototype of my case study and also doing a smaller version of it back in sweden to then feel a bit lacking activities to do with both myrthe and august coming over"
