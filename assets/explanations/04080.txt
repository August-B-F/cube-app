"a month started in sweden feeling quite overtaken but a big show in gothenburg with not really much coming out of it in terms of promotion and also feeling hurt by myrthe during a big rave concert there but then gaining happiness hanging out with a very fun british artist and back in stockholm getting quite bored and quite intolerant of the mass in liselott's apartment but happy about settling august in the countryside and checking out his new school there and at last having some nice days in the netherlands biking quite a lot and then in italy only working hard on my case-study"
