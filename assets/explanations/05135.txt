"at first walking only from my mountain apartment to the field of my cube installation with the snow and the mud not allowing me to use my tractor and then walking both in venice and in vicenza also exploring the nice town of brendola making it on top of the hills to see some ruins and spending a whole day in milan walking extensively from the station all the way through the cimitero monumentale and across the ugly western suburbs till in the end making it back to the netherlands and walking here both in culemborg as well as taking a long walk with livia across utrecht"
