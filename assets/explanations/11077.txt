"still in sweden collecting trash mostly in the small immigrant suburb where i live and then in berlin for a conference picking despite again the snow and cold weather and the fact that it was hard to find time to walk alone or having to pick with other people around avoiding to lose dignity but anyway picking nonetheless particularly on a sunny day going to galleries with some south african girls"
