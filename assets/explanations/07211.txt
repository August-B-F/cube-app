"trying to make a last painting before going to italy for the summer to work on my museum there despite the situation being quite hectic with myrthe taking more and more time for her work taking over the attic but having some time mostly in the early mornings and in the weekends and painting also to keep away from all the computer work realizing a fairly simple composition in line with the previous paintings but still with some tight corners i have been only able to sharpen doing quite some digital editing"
