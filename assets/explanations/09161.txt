"recording my thoughts while in the mist of setting up the textures of the project museum in the alps and walking up to the site on foot several times and recording when not followed by august generally feeling quite under threat and isolated and also doing quite some risky and dangerous work but at last managing only to in the end getting into a silly fight with myrthe and because of it being left alone with her leaving with the kids to the netherlands in the end also going there but feeling quite unable to record my thoughts having to constantly entertain the kids especially during our many walks"
