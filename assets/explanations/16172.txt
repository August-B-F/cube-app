"working hard now as a carpenter trying to be out as much as possible especially at the beginning during every break and with a bit of a warm sun being sent to various museums around the netherlands to work such as going to beautiful apeldoorn all coloured by the autumn leaves and several times to amsterdam to work at the stedelijk museum and from there using my lunch time to be out at times finding sun but later with the weather becoming increasingly gray and cold often finding frost on my car window early in the morning and only have some sun and decent weather towards the end of the month with still quite some cold weather and trying to be out with the kids but having to protect them from the cold wind"
