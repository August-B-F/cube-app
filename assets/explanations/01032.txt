"a terrible time spent in my native highland in italy with bad weather and my kid to take care of and my parents very cold and unwilling to give me a hand yet trying to be very playful with august using many toys and taking a few walks before returning to sweden and taking care a bit of my vegetable and there before preparing to go to austria for an exhibition and once there spending my time living in a hotel and setting up the photos of my right hand in the museum using a few tools but mostly photographing the tools used during the breakfast buffet"
