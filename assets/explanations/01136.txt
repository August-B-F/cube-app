"a month started in italy working in my show-room in the mountains and then really much characterized by a lot of exhibitions mounting first in the netherlands and then in germany where i did not really use so many tools keeping long hours in a frankfurt museum setting up my photo panels but also doing in this respect little cooking and too much socializing with other people only starting to use more objects upon coming back to august in sweden having to clean after him and his rabbits"
