"a rather polluted month still breathing the bad air of the nearby factorie next to my place and going on a picnic with august between a pharmaceutical factory and one making heat but also breathing the fresh air of the autumn taking walks by lakes before and after picking myrthe at the stockholm bus station and really experiencing the unusual stockholm traffic now that many can afford cars and again enjoying a bit of the cold fresh autumn air before going to italy and experiencing much traffic both nearby the airport in treviso and particularly in vicenza taking walks with myrthe and finally breathing good air in venice and bad air again traveling by plane and at last really good air in the netherland spending a whole day out with august and myrthe and his mom at an amusement park in the forest"
