"spending quite some time in italy at my mother's seaside despite her reluctance to land us her apartment there and taking not so many photos but still cooking and cleaning the apartment before going back to vicenza and from there also visiting the art biennial in venice and then making it back to our life in the swedish countryside resuming my vegetable garden work but also doing some painting in the traditional way but also being quite playful with my son and her cousins using many toys like balls and fake guns and masks to interact with them"
