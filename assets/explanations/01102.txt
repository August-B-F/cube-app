"leaving our aspudden apartment for good and just moving to the countryside getting at last notified of my acceptance to a doctorate in stockholm now not really feeling anymore like engaging in my old farmer tasks and going for a small holiday to at first madrid to attend to my stepsister's graduation show and later making it with the family to malaga and then further to a village on the coast enjoying our time there and taking a fair amount of photos of objects despite not really cooking or doing the things i used only in fact once making it to a restaurant with liselott as usual not willing to spend any money in the end back in sweden starting to feel rather depressed of the situation being back to my slave-like giving a hand of paint to our old red house"
