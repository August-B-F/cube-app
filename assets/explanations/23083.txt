"discussing why in principle i do not want to commit to a life as an artist in his studio doing his paintings or another kind of art explaining that i am in the first place committed to life and if i was locked up in atelier to make work to become famous i would come to miss any possible interaction with nature that makes my project so valuable and could make the arts of others very much valuable and enriching for local environments"
