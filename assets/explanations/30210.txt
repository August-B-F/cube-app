"after several hectic weeks mixing cement and building a garage in our backyard recording this lecture with much to say but also with my kids making quite some noise in the background and also feeling my wife might be hearing me so not really finding the right vibe to get in depth with things but anyhow been able to describe the progress made also with the paris exhibition and in particular with the website returning to an improved version of the old interface after a whole year since my mother threatened to turn me down with her lawyer for having dared to say some true things about her and her family deeds also in the end reflecting on the new fascist government in italy and politicians like lorenzo fontana resembling my family and my ultraconservative stepfather who also mingles with his priest in venice like mister fontana in rome"
