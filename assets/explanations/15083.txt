"a month spent inhaling less bad air first painting the archive room both with the synthetic black color and then the ceilings using yellow but also attempting to trim twice the field for my cathedral before driving with august to the seaside and finding relatively little traffic enjoying the sea air there and at last driving august to the airport finding a lot of traffic there and starting to cut the doors to the archive making a lot of powder but at last taking nice walks and even bike rides in the mountain with jake and brett breathing fresh air before driving with myrthe through france back to the netherlands and getting stuck twice in heavy traffic"
