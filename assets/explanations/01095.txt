"keeping at the beginning of the month in the countryside to plow the land despite the freezing winter approaching and later making it back to our nice life in aspudden with only one week spent in italy to reunite with my mother and her family meeting for the first time my sister's kid anna and taking many walks with her before returning to sweden and getting back to the countryside this time to prune apple trees despite the snow already coming"
