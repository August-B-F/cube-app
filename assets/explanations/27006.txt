"pictures of my paternal grandfather who was a very kind man having survived the russian retreat during the war and having come back to his native highland completely starved also having grown up without his father who immigrated to australia and never returned and hearing from his cousin the famous writer rigoni stern how much he just wanted to die during the retreat in the cold russian winter possibly affecting the whole of our family but either way with my mother breaking up all the contacts with my father family from the age of six being able to meet him until he died ten years later and regretting this quite much only having a few sweet memories of him such as sharing the same bed for our afternoon nap and beside that learning of him through my father who tells me of the time he stood up for him and from my aunts who described how honest he was even walking back the whole highland to return a few coins he got extra after a purchase and also hearing of the fact that he was always going to the local bar in the afternoon getting alcohol and perhaps dying of an alcohol related problem in the liver very likely the alcohol being an habit he took from the war and from the mountain culture there after but also as a way too handle my grandmother with quite a character"
