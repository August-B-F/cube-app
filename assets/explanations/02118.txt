"dreams written from the beginning while much traveling and yet being able to keep remembering my dreams like at my parents in italy being rather overtaken by a violent argument i had with a rich venetian woman and having a few dreams with violent content but also dreaming more often about myrthe and the way i exchange her for another girl and so also dreaming more frequently of my stepsister and her dog but turned into a dangerous one as well as fearing immigrants people in my apartment and even in bed with my son this after taking the metro with him and them to come here but also having nicer dreams with landscapes and hills despite the constant fear of my supervisor and the academic environment and also the influence of video conferencing with myrth at night and even with my biological father whom i have not talked to in years"
