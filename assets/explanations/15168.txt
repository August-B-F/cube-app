"breathing some dust carrying hundreds of heavy cement bricks from the beginning of our block to the back of our garden but generally feeling not so disturbed about the mortar i regularly mixed to lay these brick up until they got right at the face level and there smelling a bit of the mortar but generally having to protect myself more thoroughly when cutting bricks to fit them in smaller gaps and there making quite a thin dust i always tried to also wash away especially from my camera pouch and making it much worst in the end with a soar throat and quite a flu i got from little silvester and otherwise taking nice and refreshing walks with him and experiencing some car traffic especially during a one day spent in tilburg with the family to attend mathijn concert"
