"a month being quite active at home with the pandemic lock-down limiting any traveling and also being very sunny so spending a lot of time outside walking the kids mostly to various spots along the river and still working hard on my project and also developing a successful prototype for my mosaic tags and also doing quite some work out in the garden cutting brambles and planting berry trees and at last building a shed where to produce my mosaic tags"
