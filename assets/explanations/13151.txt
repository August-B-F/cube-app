"filming done in italy taking breaks from working on my cathedral project and being first in padua and later taking my father-in-law to an antique fair to then drive all together to nuremberg filming there while walking with livia and myrthe and finally getting back to the netherlands taking livia for walks and at times filming with her in my arms also on a day spent at a flea market in utrecht"
