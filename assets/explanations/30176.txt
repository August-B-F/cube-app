"giving some updates with some reflections on the book i read by carlo levi where it is stated that the main enemies of the ancient peasant class are is the middle class living within it and making a parallel with the middle class of the mountains so much going against me and the project museum also discussing how the architect wants to be credited for it even though his contribution was limited and somewhat lousy now that i cannot even have floors and discussing my attempt to do something in holland instead recovering the idea of the memory cathedral but not really getting any answer back from the sculptural park in delft where i proposed it"
