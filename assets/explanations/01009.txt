"month started out at my girlfriend's farm cutting wood for her father with quite a dangerous sewing machine and lasting several days filling up the deposit and taking care of the apple trees giving some of the fallen apples to the cows while picking several kilos to make juice as well as making my own jam picking lingonberries in the forest keeping them raw and only mixing them with sugar to then travel to gothenburg where i began teaching art at the university there and renting a room from my african swiss friend lalya gaye and mostly teaching a nice crowd of international students and then commuting back to the east coast and getting back on the farm project starting to renovate the old windows before traveling once again back to the west coast and from there reaching my great friend davide in oslo with his canadian girlfriend kristy trinier spending our time at the house of a crazy norwegian painter going half naked around the house filled with young kitties and an old guy painting with his penis on a canvas"
