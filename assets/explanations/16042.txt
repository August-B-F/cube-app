"a strong setting in of the winter with the first snow turning the landscape all white and keeping up for several days with eventually a few all blue days and sunny and minus degrees much reminding me of my native alps despite the snow being very dry and the weather at times getting warmer but then going back to something they here call wolf winter from which i took a three days break by coming to the rainy and far more humid denmark for a conference where the snow has quickly melted"
