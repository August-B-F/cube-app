"making it at last back to boston with quite some rain and wet road with now the start of the autumn having to wait for the weather to get better to take my walks and pick trash eventually do so once again with august with the weather getting better enjoying to get to the old english cemetery of mount auburn on our side of the city but also commuting all the way down to the beautiful arnold arboretum and picking trash in the stretches we walked to reach it"
