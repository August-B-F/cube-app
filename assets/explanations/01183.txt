"a month spent in the netherlands looking after little livia and keeping up with my project but also flying to sweden and staying first in stockholm for a speech at iaspis studios socializing there with my old artist friends and then going to the uppsala countryside with august for over a week mostly cooking and pausing certain aspects of my project such as painting which i resumed back in the netherlands at the end of the month and overall also spending quite some time outside with the weather turning increasingly good"
