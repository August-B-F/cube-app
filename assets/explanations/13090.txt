"films shot from the beginning in the netherlands reaching different small towns around utrecht and even exploring a national park on a canoe before going with myrthe and august to italy and traveling to different towns like feltre and exploring also a bit of nature there before going to vicenza and filming the usual environments and then going to the seaside at my parents only seldom filming beside some nice explorations of the nearby roman cities of aquileia and grado and later going with myrthe to explore ravenna and mantua really now concentrating on filming public spaces after my laptop was stolen with all the films i made about the making of my project during the vacation"
