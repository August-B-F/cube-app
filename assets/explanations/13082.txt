"films shot mostly in stockholm taking advantage of the great autumn weather while walking both with august and later with myrthe also going to northern italy and explore there for a short time the city of treviso and then mostly vicenza and venice yet without really concentrating on filming particularly in venice with my stepfather running ahead to show myrthe different locations despite the great silver light to film"
