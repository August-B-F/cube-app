"a very sunny and warm month spent almost entirely with my kids taking care of them cook and playing and taking walks often going beaches by the river and beside taking good care of my project and doing small home improvements like finishing the shed in the garden where to one day build my mosaic tags and also removing the ivy so much bothering my neighbours in the end getting ready to travel to italy with the easing of the lock-down there"
