"a last lecture in the netherlands before going to italy to mount the textures to the project museum there and talking about my last attempt to see whether i could use the mosaics i made for the cube in a land art park in delft at last convincing myself that they should be installed in italy instead fitting more the concept of the ark departing from the flat of holland and ending in a mountain as a abrahimic sort of altar with tefillin like cubes within it to store all the various month productions feeling rather in line with jewish culture and later also criticizing all the restrictions imposed on artists in holland having to do so something open and not monumental while being surrounded by an increasingly greedy building program of corporations but also of the academic industry i label as red aristocracy reflecting on how politics in general have showed their conformism in trying to censor or sabotage me but at last gaining hope to succeed in italy seeing more and more the need to remove nations and maintain geographical communities under a continental union"
