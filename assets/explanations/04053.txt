"a quite stable month with some nice emotional states experienced with myrthe here in sweden going to a little island with the sun shining and the field in flower but then later getting not so happy because of the weather turning cold again and regaining some energies biking a long way to the department summer conference and feeling a bit depressed again of the academic stagnation but then undertaking a period of sharing a lot my work with my on-line networks and feeling quite happy about the respond to finally have a nice period with august at his first boy-scout camp only disliking all the long traveling we have to undertake"
