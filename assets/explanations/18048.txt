"a bit more wind now back in scandinavia but still not much experienced as much time was spent doing carpentry work at home and seeing most the wind of the window on the trees outside and also biking and being able to annotate the wind on the mobile with one hand till finally going to the italian alps and experiencing little wind changes varying on one and another side of the peaks yet still not feeling much wind until my return to sweden"
