"not really able to take long walks on holiday with both august and livia in sardinia now because of the extreme heat only exploring a bit the coast around several beaches and visiting a few places inland as well as taking august to sassari to see a phone and exploring there but also walking a bit around the small islands of the maddalena archipelago before going back to the north of italy and walking in vicenza waiting for myrthe to arrive by train from the airport yet always having to take care of livia unwilling to seat in the stroller and later in the mountains mostly working and going up and down to the installation cube taking the same route through the valley and only at the very end talking a walk with august up to the pasubio in search for edelweiss flowers"
