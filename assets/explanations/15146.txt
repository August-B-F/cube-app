"a month having to weld twice a day in the metal workshop in the backyard and making a big effort to remove all the fumes i make so as not to inhale them wearing at all times a mask with the proper filters but not really feeling protected and also installing the ventilator in a hole in the wall buying even tubes to make the aspiration more efficient always with the issue however of back air making the welds too porous and beside that also keeping up with grouting the mosaics trying also to protect myself and during the day taking walks with the kids and trying to breath in as much air as possible and also trying to drink milk as my remedy to my itchy throat after the welding"
