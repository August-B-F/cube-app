"a quite poetic beginning of this fable with our humming bird poetry made with the humming of his wings being translated by a boy and soon however turning his humming into a most cruel blending of all terrestrial and extraterrestrial creatures setting up some sort of lounge bar for the gods who soon themselves started eliminating one another and having our bird to blend them and drink them thus creating monotheism"
