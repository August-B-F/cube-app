"a rather coldish summer with a nice beginning of the month canoeing around the biesbosch with myrthe but then experiencing cold and rainy weather back in utrecht to then go shortly to sweden to pick up august and find an amazing sunny weather there and later going to italy and enjoying some nice weather and a lot of rain during my friend alessandro's wedding but also quite some sun and heat on the beach with a few days of rain and storm like when visiting the ancient roman city of aquileia but also when visiting ravenna with myrthe to at last get a proper heat particularly back in sweden"
