"still experiencing a most beautiful spring visiting a small island with lime stone with myrthe and on the way there observing the wind over the fluorescent yellow rapeseed fields and later filming our walk around the island and checking out a museum there before filming the work of my students and lastly checking a mainstream exhibit at magasin tre in stockholm"
