"describing how my artistic ego was liberated by moving out of the pedagogically oppressive italy and starting school in the united states in not time picking up painting and also doing murals in the school but then returning to the oppressive italian environment wanting to attend the art academy and being prohibited to do it seen however ultimately this prohibition as a blessing since i had to find my own ways to make art which in the end are more close to reality than those canonized in institutional environments"
