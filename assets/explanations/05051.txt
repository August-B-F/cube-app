"not walking so much from the beginning after being at the italian seaside in the modern town of lignano with my kid and just keeping this time back in the stockholm suburbs renovating but then having myrthe as a guest and doing quite some walking both in the countryside with the car after picking her up at the airport and here in sodertalje but also around stockholm with jacek and brett and then alone around the island of djursholm and back to their place to then continue our walks also with august in my native mountains climbing several places and walking also from my parents' place down to my native town of asiago despite my son being often a bit demotivated but at last going to the natural labyrinth of the castelloni and finding him most revived going up without a break"
