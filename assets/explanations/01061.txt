"a month started in the umbrian sun exploring the many medieval villages there and feeling deeply in love with the mountains and most sad of having to return to sweden nonetheless also managing to do some cooking in our perugia apartment and keep up with the use of objects fully resuming our daily life in our uppsala apartment but getting there much affected from the lack of sleep with all the noise from the above neighbours getting quite depressed yet trying to keep outdoor with my son lighting fire behind his shitty primary school and also at home lighting fire in the old ceramic stove only seldom going to my parents-in-law having still not healed from the fight with my father-in-law and otherwise commuting a lot with the bike despite the snow and going often in the end to stockholm to teach at the design academy using some of the tools to demonstrate some electronics and in general going seldom to swim once again feeling also quite bad with my back also due to the very cold temperature"
