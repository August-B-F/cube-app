"a month harvesting more from my vegetable garden in sweden and keeping in the countryside there with the usual tasks before going back to stockholm spending time with my son there but also going to swim regularly and train before taking a short journey to italy meeting my friend jason there renting a car to reach at the pistoletto foundation where he had a residency and where we talked about possibly collaborating together and then back in sweden going fully into my work with also some welding and in general also quite some recording of public places made with my new video camera appearing quite often among other objects and making the daily sequences longer especially when traveling"
