"documentaries showing a month spent back in holland starting to produce the project museum tags this time using a laser machine and documenting in fact what i am supposed to do more than a thousand times to have all the tags ready and then showing much time spent with my children showing them the surrounding nature and the animals there and playing with them but also visiting a small and quite cheaply made biennial in the garden of a rich couple before documenting the road trip made with the children to reach southern europe"
