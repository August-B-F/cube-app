"a very hot beginning of the autumn here in the netherlands after a rainy and cold summer and almost getting a bit worried about climate change in general with such extreme events asking older people if it was usual at their times to get such phenomena but taking advantage of the weather to go for many walks with the children and also swim several times at the former mining site by the river with the afternoons getting quite hot but never really wearing any sun cream anymore being late in the season"
