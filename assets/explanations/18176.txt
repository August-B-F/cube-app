"quite some wind at times in the mountains with sudden storms setting in and also a bit of wind experienced in the cube while welding there and in the later part of the month traveling with the family down south to abruzzo and experience a nice weather at the seaside with always some refreshing wind but with it also a quite agitated sea with waves making it hard to swim especially with the children"
