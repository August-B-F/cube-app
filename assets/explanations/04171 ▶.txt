"feeling a bit sad to leave the netherlands to go to italy after feeling good for having finished my garage there but also at times feeling quite heavy for all myrthe's work related anxieties and traveling with the children finding some joy and having picks of extreme happiness at times turned into feeling of strong misery when either silvester or livia got mad and angry with each other but having fun together also reaching the mountains in italy enjoying the snow at first and then after it melted enjoying the sun taking a memorable walk together along the summano mount feeling later mostly distressed by my mother really pushing to get to meet despite all her deadly threats against my project just a year ago"
