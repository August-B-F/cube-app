"mostly recording my thoughts taking walks with livia and silvester and at times only with the former when the latter is at school and at times feeling too distracted by some important decisions i have to take for the building of the project museum but also managing to take a walk alone by the river able at last to formulate my thoughts without being interrupted or without feeling i am being hear by someone in a more urban setting also making a few recordings walking along the sea and again feeling free to speak out"
