"still quite a frozen landscape in boston with much snow but despite that venturing also to salem with my son and then with his still making it around the city and to the parks especially in the common to go with the sled but also back to the arnold arboretum and up the monumental hills in town catching a nice view of the city but also a more miserable and gray one inside it and with august still crossing the city on saturdays to make it to the cheap market despite the snow making our usual stop in quincy market for the chauda fish soup"
