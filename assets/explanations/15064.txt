"to begin with experiencing pollution while driving around in vicenza and also a bit in the town of schio below my mountain cottage but mostly breathing good and fresh air up in the mountains and even in milan despite walking all throughout it and then breathing quite some bad air going in the stockholm suburbs to look for a rabbit for august and breathing relatively clean air in the netherlands other than when driving to belgium to meet a professor and getting there a bit stuck in traffic and even breathing good air while in amsterdam but not that good commuting back to sweden and breathing the airplane emission through the air conditioning"
