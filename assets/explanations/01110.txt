"a period started with a rediscovering of the pleasure of solitude and quite an enforcement by going out like a hunter living in the extreme yet bright nature lighting fires and cooking but then much routing stuff and gray weather at the university and to my son's place where i often sleep over and we try to do things in the captivation of the small apartment such as building a shelf till at last i made up my mind about all these savings and spent them to restructure my apartment so that i can only live in my room and rent out the rest thus we went getting all the wood and bathroom and kitchen stuff to rebuild my room and a separation wall with doors but also not forgetting my showroom of my exhibition which i then start assembling doing much final work and breaking with the inertia of too much intellectualizing at the university"
