"a quite physical period to begin with in the mountains downloading the iron i brought from the netherlands and later cutting wood with my friends and moving it around before spending some days bringing the students up and down to the project museum after cutting the grass all around it and up the valley using my more practical yet still heavy machine and on my way back to the netherlands taking some powerful walks especially while in stuttgart going up and down the hills there but then back in the netherlands getting pretty much stuck with my sick children and feeling at times frustrated of the situation managing to however spend some time almost every day mixing concrete with a shovel to extend the garden path"
