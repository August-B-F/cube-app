"a month with quite a bit of a bad vibe about the curator students stealing the hard disk with the documentation of the making of my museum but then feeling happy to be with august in sweden although getting quite frustrated about his mother and back in holland enjoying the sun and much outdoor accepting to be without any income but glad to be able to pursue my project and the care of my kids"
