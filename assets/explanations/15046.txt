"a period characterized by very clean air due to a lot of wind cleaning up and mostly only smelling the neighbor factories while training out in the little park of the neighborhood and mostly be exposed to the car pollution when going to the city like in stockholm buying august scout equipment for christmas or walking to pick him up to the train station but otherwise experiencing either the sterile air inside the university where i anyway keep a window a bit open like also in my apartment sleeping with myrthe and needing extra oxygen or the much wind we have experienced when visiting jacek in malmo after the snow storm"
