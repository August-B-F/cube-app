"a month working very hard on different fronts beside taking care of the kids and making the afternoon also a time for work with silvester asleep and livia keeping outside with me while i ultimately decided to build a soundproof metal workshop in our backyard after some neighbours complained about the noise i was making and mostly dedicating myself to it during the weekends but also doing a lot of computer work improving my website late in the evenings"
