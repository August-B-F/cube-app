"weather first experienced in the netherlands with a few really warm summer days but also many days spent having to wear a jacket and some days of rain before going to italy finding generally sunny days and a little cooler temperatures in the mountains also celebrating my fortieth birthday in my native asiago and finally hitting south through tuscany with august finding extremely warm days and a bright blue sky eventually having to take shelter by the sea enjoying the right breeze especially later going to a small village in sardinia"
