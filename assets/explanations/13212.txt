"some sunny days spent in our dutch village with the shops completely closed to curb the pandemic and the public spaces quite pristine and empty turned white by a sudden winter with much snow and ice at first having to keep indoor with my youngest kid silvester not liking the cold but then really enjoying going out filming the dikes used by young people to go on sleds and the canals used for ice-skating making the films a bit like old dutch paintings depicting such winter scenes and suddenly just a week later feeling almost as if it was springtime and filming with silvester the beautiful nature of the dunes in the near of haarlem"
