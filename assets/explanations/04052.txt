"an overall emotionally nice month feeling good about working on my virtual world and then going to the quantified self conference in amsterdam gaining some honors although feeling also a bit stressed and getting angry with myrthe because she booked a trip with hanneke for the summer without telling me but then pacifying back together and only feeling a bit down about the weather but really getting back to feeling good with the nice almost summer weather feeling just melancholic about not being able to see august after he went with his mom to turkey for holidays"
