"a month feeling happy about the progress with the project museum setting up the middle and top floor there but then traveling with the family for a small holiday in abruzzo and getting a very painful neck forcing me to bed and feeling better and happy after my recovery especially finding some nice and wild beaches later also feeling happy with august spending a week with us but then also facing his bad and impassive mood especially going for an excursion in the maiella mountains with mathijn and also feeling disturbed in my birthday about my mother and sister trying to contact me despite all the threats to sue me and so forth then later feeling happy to return to the mountains and get back to work on the project museum with more and more supporters and less of the people hating me and the work showing up"
