"filming still in italy to begin with in milan but also up on the beautiful hills to then also film a bit back in sweden particularly during a nice sunny day with august in the small city of gnesta and later going to the netherlands and filming quite intensively there prior visiting also gent in belgium but being a bit unable to film because of myrthe's father guiding us and at last going to the most beautiful iseo lake in search for a land to buy and there filming both from the montisola island and from the surroundings with the sun being nicely captured by my new smart phone camera despite the fact that now i can no longer automatically join the movie clips"
