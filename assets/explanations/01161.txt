"a month leaving a bit like a homeless beside some few days spent in italy at the beginning working on my vestige and one week spent in holland working fully on my project spending the rest of the time in hostels or even camping in sweden with no much possibility to cook or doing any domestic work but mostly being vagrant and filming and using my phone extensively to record clouds and ideas"
