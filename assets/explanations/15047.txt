"a beginning of the month being rather polluted having gone to northern italy with my love and at first experiencing the fresh air of the mountains turned even cleaner by an unusual winter storm and then moving below the mountains and exploring cities with much pollution like in verona parking far out not to pay for the parking and having to walk through big road but also back in the mountains with much of a winter holiday traffic and later visiting other small cities with less pollution or not pollution at all like in the gorgeous iseo lake and finding clean air back in sweden with the cold weather and not going to often to the city"
