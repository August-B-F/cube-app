"quite a hard and dark month in uppsala with very little going to the countryside still suffering some back pain and nonetheless trying to resume training in the gym as well as in the swimming pool keeping mostly in the city only occasionally commuting to stockholm to teach and other than that in the end traveling with the family to the sunny south staying first in rome and then in the beautiful perugia keeping in a rented apartment and thus being quite able to use tools there to for example cook our meals and beside that using quite much my video camera to film the ancient public places there"
