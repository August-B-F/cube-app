"a good period for thoughts especially during a period i spent in the near of maastricht taking care of the dog of my partner's older brother and with it going for several long walks in the lonely hills recovering the sort of peace of mind i can never fully obtain in the more urbanized setting of our countryside village nd back to it still getting good thoughts but never fully be able to express myself with also the bad weather hindering me"
