"quite clean air living with myrthe in tranquil utrecht and then going to birmingham and staying in the warwick university campus and breathing fresh air rather than when walking into the city of coventry breathing the early morning traffic and then much breathed at airports spending the night in stockholm and smelling the airplane pollution while waiting for august and then again going to pick myrthe from the italian seaside that has very clean air to the airport through a lot of traffic with trucks and jams"
