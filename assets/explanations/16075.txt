"an okay weather in dublin to begin with experiencing in one day all sorts of weathers while by the coast and at last the usual irish rain before going to my mountain cottage in italy and finding a bit of a cold but quite sunny weather getting increasingly nice despite small snow storms and terrible strong winds at night but then also enjoying the milan sun over a day and then back to sweden finding an amazing weather particularly spent with august in his apartment"
