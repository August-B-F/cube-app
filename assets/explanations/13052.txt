"spending more time in vicenza exploring this time at night to then depart by train to vienna being quite hit by the very cold humid weather there but nonetheless managing to walk through the entire city even reaching on foot the quite far danube river and then returning back to the city and visiting without a particular aim all the quite dead monumental and imperial architectures there upon returning to the sweet hills of italy and there getting quite a feeling of wanting to return to such an atmosphere looking at villages below my native highland and exploring the golden landscapes there at last making it slowly back to sweden stopping at first in begamo to cath my plane and exploring there the high up old town"
