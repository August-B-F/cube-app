"a month back in holland getting regular dreams despite all the waking up of livia in the night and at times having no dreams with little sleep having to look after her in the morning and getting quite affected by the news as well as by some movies but lastly becoming more disciplined and going to bed earlier and without watching any tv and sleeping much longer also thanks to a new bed with a better mattress and a lot of walking in the dutch landscape"
