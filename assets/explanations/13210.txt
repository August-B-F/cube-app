"films recorded now with the coming of the winter and my hands feeling rather cold as usual pushing the stroller with my kids inside and exploring the places in and around our dutch village but also making it to bigger cities in the weekend such as to arnhem and later to utrecht still being pretty much always with the kids and finding very nice places to feel despite the limiting options also set forth by coronavirus pandemic"
