"roaming around with my son very intensively the shanghai parks fully captivated by the life there with all its events and performances and much magic avoiding any tourist site or doing any of the things done by expats in their glamorous segregated communities and shopping site becoming with my son one with the chinese community until being forced by a new rule to leave the country every month to renew my visa and going with the whole family to hong kong finding a much more modern city yet very emptied out of the life we would find in shanghai with only few locals doing anything in the more western type of parks and really in the end finding the indonesian and phlippians women coming to the city to housemaids to bring life in these parks during their free time"
