"spending most of my time with the kids singing songs to them but also playing on my phone the songs i learned in sweden while taking care of august and also hearing livia singing songs often out of context such singing birthday songs with no one actually having any birthday and also hearing some of the songs played by the cartoons she watches and beginning also to hear silvester singing a few songs again at times out of context such christmas songs well after christmas but also having him requesting me to sing for example the heidi before sleeping"
