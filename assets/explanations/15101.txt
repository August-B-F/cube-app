"a period started in the mountains working with my chainsaw and the newly bought winch and also breathing the bad air flying back but to the netherlands with fresh air there until i started renovating the bedroom plastering and painting the window inside and later driving quite a lot with our new car to attend the christmas celebrations and show august around till at last chilling out and spending holiday time with august also going running and breathing clean air"
