"listening a lot of new music like while driving in the car or partying with friends in a few instances using the internet to play revolutionary songs but mostly the songs came from a trip on a russian cruise where popular songs from the last two decades were constantly being played in corridors, waiting halls but also bathrooms, some songs also were recognized from street musicians like a russian jazz band playing american hits and two gypsies playing old italian hits"
