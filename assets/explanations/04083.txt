"spending some nice time with august doing a small holiday at the sea side in central italy but then going back to renovate and feeling quite bad about all the chemicals and dust till at last getting some nice walk with jacek and brett uplifting me and also traveling through france with myrthe and biking in holland only experiencing bad days there stuck in the house with bad weather or traveling too late at night to sweden"
