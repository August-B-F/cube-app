"painting executed in the far end wall of my studio now well equipped with all colors hanging on a little shelf at my waist and started also to get a bit freer in painting shapes that are more organic with still some subtractions of circular shapes from a water like layer coming from above but also enjoying to experiment with fine textures like adding dark orange on purple and gold on yellow and resuming the use of white and black mostly on the main gray background having also little of that colour left"
