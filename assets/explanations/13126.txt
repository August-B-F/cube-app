"films of public spaces captured on my way down from holland to italy making a nice stop in the city of mainz which i first through to be quite ugly because of the war bombing but in fact turned out to be very pretty with both historical and modern places and then again spending a day in frankfurt this time with myrthe and revisiting the beautiful modern part with all of junkies and at last in germany visiting florian in the beautiful south before crossing switzerland and making a few films of public spaces at last parking the van along the road to take small breaks at the gorgeous como lake to at last film in vicenza and later in venice searching for an apartment"
