"having quit my job now no longer having to breath any dust particles but still at times renovating the attic of our dutch house cutting and installing quite some plaster boards making it a bit dusty and then trying to be out with my kids and their mom in the few sunny days at times going for walks like in the near of arnhem finding the city rather polluted and later traveling to italy finding almost no traffic crossing germany but getting quite shocked about the situation in the surrounding of milan while waiting for my oldest son to land at the airport there getting very depressed of the smog and old infrastructure even reaching my native highland to explore a place where to build my new installation finding quite some traffic in asiago with many fancy tourists with fancy cars at last making it to our small apartment in santa caterina enjoying the fresh air there"
