"recording at last back in the attic of our dutch house after myrthe wanted to get a bigger window there and i have no longer any studio time being at work full time and updating a bit about my work at stedelijk with actual pictures of all the wood gone to wast for every exhibition comparing it with my attempt to build a fully sustainable and autonomous work also showing the tables i have built for the amsterdam ship museum and talking about davide's comment saying i should be the artist exhibiting and not the craftsman making the pedestal for him or her and find it more significant to be the latter especially in these highly ideological times when manual skills are left behind and also talking about some how to go about with the tags and myself getting at last upset with the architect who does not wish to proceed with the building of the stairs and the floors of the project museum"
