"keeping up welding the project museum textures together with nets holding them up and welding but inhaling less fumes now with august cutting them by hand and only using the trimmer to try to fix the door and at times to better connect some textures together and right in the middle of the month taking a long break with no one helping me with the kids and going with them to my mother's seaside place breathing them the fresh sea breeze and at last returning to the mountains and resuming the building of the project museum with the generator inside it and the exhaustion having more and more troubles to make it out the more august and i kept building the second floor and feeling a bit intoxicated from them"
