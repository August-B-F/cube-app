"right back from the russian trip now taking walks around the city and the suburbs where my kid leaves which i am about to leave for an industrial suburb down south which i also explore particularly when the snow comes and i take advantage of some beautiful days in which i also walk long distances to save money and get into some really nice landscapes like a winter lake where i used to take my kid"
