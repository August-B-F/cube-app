"a very strong experienced in sweden living quite homeless first in a tent and later talking my parents around the city till at last going back to the netherlands and experiencing quite a lot of wind there and a little less wind allowing me to take long bike rides yet still experiencing a bit of wind till finally coming to venice and feeling just the right wind to cool the summer heat"
