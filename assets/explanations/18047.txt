"experiencing very little strong wind but being out quite a lot and in fact getting a lot of wind variations but never so intense if not for a time waiting outside the airport but otherwise walking through the english ondulated landscape and experiencing light breeze and then no breeze below the small hills and really little wind experienced while at the italian seaside in lignano"
