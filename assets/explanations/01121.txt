"a month spent doing mostly documenting activities in the first place being traveling around northern italy with myrthe and jacek and then coming back to stockholm and again not doing many activities with myrthe coming over for a few days and then not really undertaking any carpentry work but being often at the university trying to create new collaborations but also doing more distracting work not to think about my supervisor situation such as painting and drawing and even cooking less than usual when myrthe has been around"
