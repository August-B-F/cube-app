"a month spent getting quite much into my own research and thus doing quite a lot of office related activities like printing at the university and having to use my card in order to access the printer and then photograph again the computer mouse going back to my office but also a month spent a lot with august walking around and filming and in a few occasions at the swimming pool after many years but this time not bringing my camera along and only swimming with long periods without using any object as it is also the case for the few times i traveled to the netherlands at the beginning and at the end of the month"
