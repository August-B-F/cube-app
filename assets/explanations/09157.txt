"still getting good insights but having troubles speaking them out with always the kids interrupting me for one reason or another but during some longer walks into nature a bit disturbed by the wind but sometime with some pleasant weather and reaching the open fields having really no worries to be heard and managing to speak out and give some good insights with a times my throat quite sore due to also the intense welding i have been undertaking to finish the textures of the project museum"
