"music heard while first with my son at the italian sea side taking him to small amusement parks and reviving some songs belonging to my youth but also songs to celebrate my birthday and later spending a period in sweden alone almost hearing no songs until myrthe's arrival and listening to her singing to me love songs and then traveling with her and august to my native mountains listening songs there from a traditional choir but also a cd with music in my mom's car while driving up a mountain covered in fog"
