"still filming in and around culemborg taking long walks with livia bringing her from one little farm to another and then taking my time to travel to italy and stopping in several german towns like speyer and then the beautiful heidelberg getting at least a feeling of what was a german city before the war andalso visiting the small village where a turkish friend grew up and finally visiting smaller towns closer to the alps and possibly also similar to the towns where my bavarian ancestors came from"
