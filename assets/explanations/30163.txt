"giving an update about my joining of a protest against the bombing of gaza and making a statement about the need not to side for any flag but rather to embrace syncrethism and later discussing about the upcoming work in italy with the texture having reached the place but the people increasingly more hostile against me yet finding it a good result to have built a islam kaaba in the middle of a most christian and conformist community and discussing how i operated in such ways also in sweden and in the netherlands using religioug icons that are the opposite of the ones brought forward by the governments there also mentioning how my oldest son is deserting me and how i just need to understand that i will have to deal with the building alone as ferdinand cheval also did"
