"a month started in italy working really hard in my mountain cottage now deciding to build my show-room there despite myrthe still wanting me to do things in the netherlands and now building also a wall with a shelf to host my archival boxes while also preparing the living room to host all my devices and later going shortly back to sweden and doing quite some cleaning in liselott's apartment and then working only a little in the netherlands on my archival model running around to organize a small exhibit there and finally going back to sweden using not so many objects particularly while traveling until at last coming back to italy and resuming all my work with a lot of traveling by car to get equipment and the extra phone i use to check my emails"
