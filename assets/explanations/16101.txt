"a month started at an indian ashram in kerala experience some tropical heat but nonetheless having little visibility with clouds protecting us from the sun and later going with davide to madurai experiencing the same weather and even rain making the streets hard to walk on before finally leaving the city environment and moving to the countryside of tiruvannamalai and feeling quite hot walking around shiva mountain and later exploring desert like environment with the scooter but at last on the full moon day with thousands of people on the street getting a quite severe hurricane which forced us in our bungalow waiting to go back to sweden finding a very cold weather with snow and ice and having to readjust my tanned body but quickly experiencing there a change of temperature with a warmer weather melting all the snow and some days of sun but too short before going to italy and finding their amazing blue sky"
