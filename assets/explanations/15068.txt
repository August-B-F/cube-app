"a month started in san francisco biking through some traffic trying to reach a natural reserve and then getting a bit of traffic while walking with jacek from our dormitory all the way to fort mason where we organized an exhibit but anyway getting a quite cold and refreshing air before coming back to a warm sweden spending time with august in the clean air there and only getting to inhale some bad air biking with him to see a movie in a mall under construction and lastly while in italy in the traffic of the small town at the feet of our mountain"
