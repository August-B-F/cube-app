"shooting quite much around boston and mostly in new york avoiding a bit the actual city and at last ending mostly in central park finding quite a nice environment there with gothic like landscapes and eventually walking also with jason but not really filming much in places i have already explored particularly brooklin with my son with whom i took a nice walk with myrthe on his first visit here taking shots of nice sceneries on the ridge in the south part of stockholm and then in the suburbs yet still being quite modest not to interrupt the flow with others"
