"very cold beginning of the summer despite being for a time in madrid leaving a rather warm utrecht but then going back to a fairly rainy and cold and much unstable stockholm where at last the weather got a bit nicer and august washable even to swim for a short time but then going to holland and there finding cold and rainy weather getting better only towards the end"
