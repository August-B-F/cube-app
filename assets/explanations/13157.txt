"in the heart of provence roaming around with little august and doing many small adventures like entering an abandoned abbey and visiting some old mines going from village to village as well as going on top of an aqueduct before making our way back and filming the conservative spaces of lyon and later the much more charming dijon to finally reach the flat and square netherlands where i filmed mostly public spaces in amsterdam while myrthe was visiting with livia a friend there"
