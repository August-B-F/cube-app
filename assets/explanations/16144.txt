"cold and windy weather experienced in hamburg but also one day of sun and finding a much milder weather in the netherlands with still some rain and only few nights going below zero but then offering some sunny weather at times and being much outside with august coming over for christmas holidays with a very cold day spent hiking the hills and a very warm one walking the dunes in the north of the netherlands but then also experiencing some overcast and cold humidity"
