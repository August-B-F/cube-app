"portraits taken during a small art fair in stockholm with all non-profit gallery organizers with whom i have socialized while walking with a mask during a performance and meeting a kind of cool jewish musician with his own pavilion as well as some chinese tourist girls with whom i tried to talk chinese and then meeting a really perverted woman from chicago who was really keen to invite me out and finally a strange couple operating in the island of gotland who wanted me to try to drink some polluted water for an art project"
