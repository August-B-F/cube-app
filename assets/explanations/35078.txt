"able only to do part of this texture missing the smallest pieces to do the upper left corner but despite that managing well to do the rest comprising of long pieces with the bottom one slightly falling down struggling very much later realizing i made a mistake and having to kick hard with my foot on both side to break the texture open and then having to use a grinder to remove all the weld and put it together but also having to cut smaller a ten by ten piece to fit on the top right"
