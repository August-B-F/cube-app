"beside a first week spent at my old friend's brian place in brooklyn exploring new york city quite thoroughly with a most indefatigable little august even making it on foot all the way to central park and back keeping very much outdoor and using not so many object than the camera and some cooking utensils in brian's and his girlfriend's house with the filtered water carafe we also got in boston and a blue water bottle found in front of the brooklyn public library later however returning to boston and moving in the trashy neighborhood of east cambridge renting there the attic of a portorican family and getting in quite a routine with august also starting in the nearby public school and myself at home reading a lot and updating and expanding my project especially while liselott sat off to work and i could update in peace without all her anger and jealousy towards my project hiding the backup in a little square piece of wood hanging over the desk i carried in from the street along with other furniture meant to be thrown and toys for little big august"
