"at last biking again after the long winter break and trying to go upstream in the leek river but finding a major renovation of the dike and having to go through smaller road getting quite against the wind and feeling afraid of the dogs running loose and later also biking a bit with august during his carnival visit but only downstream to the next village and at last experiencing a lot of bad weather till finally taking the bike before leaving for sweden and going far down to the waterfall thinking hard whether or not to buy the land below my cathedral and finding strong wind on the way back not really allowing me to bike as fast as i wished"
