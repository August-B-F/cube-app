"still welding in the metal workshop now avoiding to use the fume aspirator directly on the texture so as not to compromise the welding and doing an okay job despite really trying not to breath in the fumes and also taking the picture with too much sun outside also having to add an extra piece in the bottom left corner that was not attached to anything"
