"still more time spent in madrid with only a day spent in a small village where my half sister private university was located and where her graduation took place later only to make it briefly to madrid again and then taking the train with the family south to malaga exploring a bit of the city there to then direct ourselves east to the smaller and not so interesting town of almunecar making it a few times to the not so nice beach but then getting wuite impressed visiting with the family the sierra and the small arab villages there becoming very nostalgic of such mountain landscape and so depressed about having to return to sweden spending some splending ime with my family also in the much nicer sea town of nerja"
