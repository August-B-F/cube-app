"a month spent in italy yet still unable to work on my installation getting quite frustrated about all the slow bureaucracy but managing to take walks uphill pushing my kids in the stroller and exercising quite well and also getting the help of some students to begin rolling heavy stones next to the installation site before talking with them an energetic walk up the pasubio mountain and then resuming my walks uphill pushing the kids"
