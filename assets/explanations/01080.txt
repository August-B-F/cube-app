"back from israel resuming the colorful life in our swedish countryside house still having to attend to our hygiene in a traditional manner and still trying to live off my own food in the end also getting much ready to depart once more with the whole family this time for a new life in the united states and using very few objects traveling there also considering the jet lag to begin with being host by an old indian friend chandana and then getting our own apartment for a month in brookline really enjoying our life there especially with august walking very extensively around the city and even catching the commuter across it to go to the beach to the north of boston generally cooking our own meals and certainly not going out to est as in our previous year in cheap china"
