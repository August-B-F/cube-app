"telling how attracted to folk music i am and how i can stumble upon it watching a movie or reading a book and i then try to memorize it and read about a particular song and then also sing it to my children describing how i can be in control of my emotions but can release them through certain songs especially a lot of nostalgic feelings for lost people"
