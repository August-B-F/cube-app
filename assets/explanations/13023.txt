"still in hong kong going around quite a lot with my son while leaving his mom in a hostel with her constant headaches and with him even venturing out to a former pirate island exploring the whole place walking up and down the hills and almost swimming in a gulf filled with sharks later returning to the big city and walking some more around reaching some high up view before returning all together to shanghai and here just spending my whole time with my son in parks absorbing the traditional chinese life with the constant performing of its people and only once going to the touristic area of pudong filming there the new and empty side of chinese cities i almost never look into"
