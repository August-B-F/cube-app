"a big shift now that after ten years since the very beginning of the project i have separated from my swedish girl and went to live in the suburbs thus dreaming several times about my new place, about different girls, potential new girlfriends but also much time spent commuting and thus several train based dreams with some fear about the actual suburb where i have moved that has a bad reputation for immigrant crime, some dreams related to university assignments and supervisors but also a bit of dreaming about my soon christmas holiday at my parents and in poland with jacek and some birds related dreams influenced by my fable writings and at last some influence from my new black room-mate from talking a lot about his motherland gambia"
