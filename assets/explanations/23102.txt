"departing from eitenne de la boite to think how with my project i am not the slave of the system but i am the slave of mother nature but i also have a great pity for children who are obliged to be part of the system and in this respect i follow them while also providing them a counter education in nature in the hope they can avoid to fall in the trap of having to waste their life in an office contributing to a system which is in fact not only detrimental to them but also to the natural world overall"
