"a memorable yet straining month doing a lot of physical work in my alpine barn bringing me in a rather stable emotional state reading regularly seneca and feeling strong within with some moments of delusions with the works never actually starting and again some issues with myrthe wanting to go to a festival but then spending a nice weekend together also in venice where my temper got high with the locals skipping queues at the ferry but then being a little crazy roaming the city without my parents and feeling happy of the fruit garden i planted despite all the elders keeping me under surveillance telling what not to do"
