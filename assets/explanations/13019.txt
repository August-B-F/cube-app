"some night shots of the northern part of shanghai coming back late from work after spending much time to finish off my work with the students at tongji but then slowly rebelling to the idea of working my chinese boss and breaking loose now spending much time with august in parks and making only once out of shanghai to wuxin getting more into a chinese atmosphere there before coming back to shanghai often making it back with my son but also his italian classmate filippo to the park south of the french concession but also visiting other parks in the city like a big cultural hub and some very interesting public places with the miserable gray and polluted weather becoming more crisp and sunny"
