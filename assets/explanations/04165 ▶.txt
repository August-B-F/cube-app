"a month feeling very happy about traveling with the children and exploring germany together later in the mountains feeling still very happy with them when moving around especially in the golden fields down the mountains but also having quite low moments when inactive just looking after them sort of stuck in our mountain village only later however finding a good balance with a girl looking after them a couple of hours in the mornings enabling me to start welding the floors of the project museum"
