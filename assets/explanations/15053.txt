"a pretty clean summer month experiencing traffic crossing stockholm but then spending a lot of time at home and finally experiencing a lot of traffic biking to the university summer conference and especially biking back next to big mines with dusty trucks going in all directions and also inhaling the fresh asphalt of a road built next to my apartment and lastly also a lot of the nearby factory pollution probably due to the wind blowing from the north and bringing in the bad air"
