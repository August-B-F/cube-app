"finding it very interesting how the mayor of the town where i want to build my project museum at last opted not to have a german artist putting his stolpersteine sidewalk brass plaques commemorating the houses from where jews were deported during fascism and coming to conclude how the right in general wants a national type of mainstream narrative and does not wish any type of personal narratives which in the end are the most nourishing and the most useful for humanity comparing now also the plaques i want to add to the museum as these sort of plaques"
