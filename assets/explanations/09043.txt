"recordings did the times i could really be alone such as walking from august's apartment to the main station wanting to save money for the train ticket or particularly during a conference in england escaping when i could to explore the countryside and walk many miles reacting on the intellectual boredom and vanity of the conference and attempting to enforce myself through my own discipline and at last after long periods spent with my son august and my girlfriend myrthe mostly on holiday in italy being finally left alone in sweden and biking to some natural reserves where i could walk alone and pour out my thoughts again in relation to my situation conducting my own autonomous practice within a highly politicized and socialized academic environment"
