"despite the winter being at its peak i started my major hiking experiencing once more with my left knee not bothering me so much and with all i have to seat or stand otherwise at work and on the metro then from the beginning i took a major walk from nearby the university across a frozen lake and many suburbs and forest and across another lake which brought me to a immigrant ugly suburb yet beautifully located and then many a walk otherwise with my kid from the north part of town where the commuter rail station is and to the south part where the station to my commuter rail is but also a nice walk with him to asmund's birthday discovering intuitively a very nice passage by the railroad to the south of town and then a beautiful panoramic path along the cost walking all along also in the evening with the snow fall and then also walking with august again for small different commissions with a rented car in outside shopping malls and back from the metro station to his mother's place from where at last with a first day of spring i have walked all the way back to the city for hours across the still frozen small and big lakes"
