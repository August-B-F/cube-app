"a period getting quite distorted dreams watching some really bad american series but also getting some dreams inspired reading old stories from my anthology and having little silvester breaking up my night crying for milk making it at times hard to remember them and in the mountains in italy dreaming quite a lot with little internet and no television even dreaming for the first time while taking an afternoon nap"
