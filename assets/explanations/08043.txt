"a fable written at last after a summer of moving around and not really being able to write fables with all the evening spent on holiday where however i have been observing many animals and still quite being impressed by the gull also by looking at a documentary with my son of a little sort from iceland and writing a fable where again the animal goes through a metamorphosis and at last resto real humans to eden but then turn all angels into devils and in this respect keep changing the courses of what would be otherwise immutable like the heavens"
