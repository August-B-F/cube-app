"alone in the mountains with baby livia managing to go up to the cathedral to work and experiencing some wind there but most of all descending by car to visit my parents in vicenza going through quite some turbulence and also being in vicenza checking clothes for livia in a garage with my mother getting quite some cold wind even when driving away from italy through the small mountain roads covered with a thick layer of leaves brought by the wind and back in the netherlands only occasionally experiencing some wind but never too much also being much more indoor"
