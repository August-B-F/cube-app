"a month spent in my native highland to begin with with my mother being completely happy about me giving her my part of the family company without getting paid and just letting us lodge for a few days in a residence enjoying the sun and the snow there before visiting first my granmother from my father side and then my grandfather from my mother side and then returning to sweden recovering my usual stockholm life training regularly at the swimming pool and just seldmo going to the countryside feeling quite hyped up about the idea to lead a whole new master program in digital media at the konstfack college of art and design only resulting into a bluff and just leading individual courses there teaching much electronics to the students prior making it to the countryside finding the days a bit longer and sunnier lighting fires with my kid and roasting sausages in the open"
