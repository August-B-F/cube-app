"still working quite hard on our new garage breathing more of the mortar going up with the bricks and making the top edges in the end also plastering the outside and later the inside walls covering myself up with a proper mask but still getting to smell the additives in the cement also getting exposed to the traffic of our village walking the main road from livia's school to center and beside that taking several refreshing walks like in the amersfoort forest with the little family and in the end alone with silvester both on the east and on the west of the dike only once going with him to amsterdam to look for some second hand books and getting exposed to the traffic there"
