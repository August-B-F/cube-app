"still an increasing traffic in our small dutch town turning into a city with a lot of house developing projects on the west side but then experiencing less traffic with several consecutive days of rain and no longer any two wheels running around also the city center and in this weather also starting to mix a lot of concrete bags to make the floor for a garage in our backyard spending several days at first using a machine and then only with a shovel to mix hundreds of bags trying to cover my face as best as possible in the end having to wear two masks to really don't get affected by the dust and only one weekend taking a break with my family and going with them to a forest and then visiting the city of apeldoorn finding much traffic there"
