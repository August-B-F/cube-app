"picture of my great life friend davide di saro i met at first in italy and inviting him to study abroad with my in the netherlands living together in a squatted school there and later in a van before he convinced me to attend a master in sweden and from there departing with him moving to canada and meeting only occasionally both in italy but also in canada where he got me to meet my father after over twenty years but only truly getting to become friends again traveling together in southern india and getting a lot of help from him setting up a show-room in the mountains and later the museum realizing that without his help i would have never being able to build it and accepting our time apart with him always quite reluctant to come to northern europe to visit always preferring to travel in warm countries dating different women and becoming somewhat of my goldmund counterpart or like a pan creature accompanying my dyoinisian journeys often only finding in davide the sole spectator of my work and the sole person who truly appreciated mostly only the visual work being him not so keen in reading"
