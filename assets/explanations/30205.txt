"recording this lecture just before having to reach my family at the lake and here discussing about reasons why i don't feel compelled to be in italy near my project museum anymore with anyway quite a production of project museum tags set up here in holland and more deeply feeling that either way i am just simply not allowed to put the love i wish into my land discussing more and more now the anarchist cause for freedom and how its protagonists has been erased in the last century finding almost no where the writing of great anarchists such as nestor makhno at last also describing the situation in italy where only the privileged get a position like the brother of my dead friend eugenio whose mother was the vice director of the italian national television and he magically became one of the main journalists there making a news item without any critic for example on the new american oligarchs who are set to make the world more automated and enslaved"
