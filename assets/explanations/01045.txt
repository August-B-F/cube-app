"another month still taking more photos now using a video-camera to record public places and generally having a lot to do both in stocholm working with my japanese friend yoshi at novel ways to retrieve my archive like spreading a floor with rfid tags and getting a remote control car with a rfid reader on to explore my dreams associated to each tag but also in the countryside doing quite some harvesting and going often in the forest to pick lingon either way training a lot still while in the city swimming as well as going to the gym and daily writing my dreams first in notebooks and then having to transcribe them almost as the first thing done every day"
