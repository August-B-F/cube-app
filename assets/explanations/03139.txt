"songs listened to or sang during the lock-down spending most of the time alone with our kids but also trying to be with other kids like organizing small concerts for them outdoor in front of our albanian pianist friend playing mostly dutch songs for her and otherwise also dancing in the evening rediscovering old swedish songs and otherwise singing the usual songs with a lot of pinocchio melodies to little silvester who started reacting to it"
