"a month spent in the mountains at first taking care of the kids with only time very early in the morning and late in the evening to weld every four of the museum textures together and then after myrthe's departure to the netherlands getting help from a local girl to look after the kids and having some time in the morning and in the afternoon with august and later also with the brother of the girl to start welding the textures on the actual museum using pretty much the same tools over a long time so not really taking many photos of objects and at times having to take photos high up despite being afraid of heights ultimately having no one to help me with the kids and spending the last days of the month at the seaside using very little objects with the usual issues to having to carry my camera also when at the sea and with little silvester not really allowing me to even cook always wanting to be with me"
