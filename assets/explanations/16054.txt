"still a nice autumn here in sweden but then experiencing the first rains particularly in the netherlands where i anyway had to write and finding again quite a nice weather back in sweden also being with august out by the water with no shirt enjoying the sun and latter also in berlin with myrthe finding a very nice weather but quite cold evenings like taking her to the station in the middle of the night and having to walk a lot at sunrise to fully warm up and finally coming back to sweden with the weather also quite rainy but even some periods of sun which allowed me to be out running"
