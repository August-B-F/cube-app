"visiting for the first time the other side of the river in shanghai going to the fancy pudong and realizing how lifeless it all is standing just as an empty facade to the city but really finding much more life and interesting public places to film keeping in the near of the french concession particularly next to the jing'an temple and mostly in xujiahui park where i tried to make it almost daily with my son august but also exploring together other parks before making it briefly to sweden for my exhibition there and feeling i no longer wanted to have my family in shanghai desiring to go back to the cleaner air of sweden finding my wife back in shanghai quite distressed and not willing to leave china"
