"a fable with a water snake certainly inspired by the time with august on the swedish beach from which the story evolves to then get completely on the desert most likely influenced by all the middle east conflict with some sexual spice into it probably now added from my relationship with myrthe and all the love we make and much of a biblical middle point event going through the most relevant world religions throughout the fable"
