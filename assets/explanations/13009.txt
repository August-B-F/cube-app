"filming at first the idyllic midsummer celebration at the vallonian mining town of osterbybruk places to the film in and around uppsala turned brighter by the sun and often going for a swim before going off for a long hike in the fjall mountains by the norwegian border in storlien and exploring the beautiful ridges there despite the weather being most awful and then back to civilization at last traveling with my family to italy and finally to my home town crowded with tourists but not high up in the mountains where i guided the family of my chinese colleague and filmed the nice scenery with also a bit of filming at the sea-side while my colleague kept in quarantine at my parents infected by swine flu"
