"a month inhaling with some bad air while exploring brussels and later back to the pure dutch countryside inhaling only at times bad air mounting the living room door and plastering the wall where the old door used to stand and breathing bad air reaching utrecht by bike but then going back to sweden finding very clean fresh air in uppsala taking extensive walks but then also inhaling the bad stockholm air particularly sleeping in a dormitory next to a busy street and finally returning to the netherlands only working in my study breathing fine air"
