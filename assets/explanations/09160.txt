"some recording of thoughts while walking in the rather empty and run down suburbs in rotterdam and the going to italy and here walking far less other than up to the museum at first to inspect it and later to add the textures around it and reflecting in my thoughts about all the fuss set up against me by the hunters and the far right but also seeing the sort of power of creative thinking and later managing to record more thoughts at my mother's seaside place walking with the kids in what is left of the former forest there and reflecting on the increasing level of luxury investing a much decaying italian but also european society"
