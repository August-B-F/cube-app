"a month started in beautiful provence with sun and blue sky despite the late season and then experiencing the cold and humid weather of northern france driving up north at last to be confined in my new work in a small factory not able to experience any day light but during the short breaks with the sun going progressively behind the factory in front with the days shortening up and the winter hour setting in feeling also quite sad for my children so used with me to keep outdoor but at last always finding ways to go a bit out together in the evening and in the weekend with the weather also getting colder but also drier"
