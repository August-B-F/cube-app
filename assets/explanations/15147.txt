"a month welding intensively to finish at last the textures of my museum and struggling a lot to protect myself fully from the fumes even adding an extra filter inside the mask and against my nose but at last opting to buy a second hand welding helmet with a ventilator and using that throughout my morning and evening welding section still getting a but of throat pain and with my neighbour complaining also about the fume aspirator having at last to put it outside making it far less effective and at last buying a long tube to also keep the mask ventilator outside especially after finding the filters completely saturated and being unable to order new ones in the netherlands ultimately with this set up finishing the work and spending more time now taking walks and even running to fill my lungs with fresh air but also experiencing some traffic in town going to the industrial area to ship the textures and traveling to a land art foundation in delft getting in a lot of traffic despite also going to big cities like utrecht and amsterdam finding them like ghost town due to the lock-down following the pandemic"
