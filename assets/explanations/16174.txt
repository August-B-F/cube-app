"a very gray and snowless period of the winter with some picks of cold and just a few sunny weather bringing almost the feeling of spring but other than that many gray days one after the other now stepping back from working full time and mostly keeping in utrecht building an exhibition there and other than that also spending these gray winter days renovating our attic but also making it a point to be outdoor with my kids enjoying at least the total lack of wind especially towards the end"
