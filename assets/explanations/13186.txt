"filming to begin with in schio not knowing whether i can proceed or not with my work in the mountains and then going to pick up my girlfriend's mother and her boyfriend in the near of garda lake and there taking a nice trip to mantua exploring it yet having to also take care of livia not willing to seat in the stroller and often time recording with her in my arms and filming limitedly up in the mountains before visiting trento still with my in-laws and livia who managed to sleep in the stroller allowing me to explore the upper part of the city to the castle and finally leaving italy by car alone and stopping in munich finding there rain and cold weather but still strolling around it"
