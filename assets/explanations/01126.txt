"a quite diverse week again characterized by a lot of smartphone usage to keep in touch with myrthe but also characterized by two camping excursions going first with august to the boy scouts and using different tools there i did not use for a long time like a shovel to dig a hole for the compost and also camping with myrthe and their friends to a music festival and not really bringing my computer there nor being allowed to use my camera so using little objects but then spending the last period in utrecht being quite busy producing t-shirts with my drawings and taking other small initiatives for my project but also keep up with my biking after having got a used bike with a set of small tools to repair it and also making sure to get some cooking going and use all of myrthe's kitchen several times to prepare good meals even for guests"
