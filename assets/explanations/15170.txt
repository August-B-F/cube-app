"finishing off building the garage in the back of our dutch house and setting out for a journey across france finding not so much traffic on the way but with the kids walking in the suburbs of french cities and especially metz encountering a most awful traffic with also no wind to blow it away and later in italy staying in our small mountain apartment pretty much always breathing a good and clean air with our chimney working properly beside for at times making some smoke cooking or breathing the smoke of the neighbours like of old gianna gasoline based heating or of old andrea trying to heat up his house"
