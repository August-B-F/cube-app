"emotionally very happy days traveling to italy with my love despite the long journey and the bad weather in the mountains now also feeling reassured about my future in academia and later much enjoying the italian cities despite only the presence of myrthe's mother that got a bit irritating but really getting enthusiast with also jacek after fantastic walks in amazing locations and getting quite down back in sweden but again very happy of the prospect of changing environment but at last being completely squeezed by my old supervisor and forced to go through them in order to improve my situation"
