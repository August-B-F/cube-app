"a painting conceived in my new apartment studio now that the situation has been stabilized and i no longer have to put my painting in process away but can leave it hanging on the wall and thus finally i was able to paint with the board standing vertically as i have always wished since it is in this position that the outcome of the project, the resulting drapes are meant to be shown meantime i also have been working more on mixing different colour in the same background and rather simplifying the palette of the layers interlacing each other resulting in only four main ones which again shift slightly in tonality having myself work harder on giving them different nuances"
