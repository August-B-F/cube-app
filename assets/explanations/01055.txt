"a month started still camping out with my russian friend pyotr and my family in the rainy island of aland but then returning this time to our new apartment in the city of uppsala and there doing some small improvements but also keeping up my domestic life only towards the end making it to the countryside despite some back pain and feeling quite bumped and depressed about the weather doing not so much gardening as i used to"
