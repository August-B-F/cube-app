"a month spent almost fully in the swedish countryside this time quite much combining my work in the nature there with the screen of my video-camera documenting the places i visit becoming more present and even towards the end after a brief trip to my mother in italy traveling with an old volvo we bought to the island of aland in the baltic sea to take a bike tour with my russian friend pyotr and with a most shitty summer weather also keeping track with a clumsy gps device the places where i filmed and other than that off and on being quite interactive and playful with my son often appearing in the pictures while playing with him"
