"a warm summer in the italian alps during the village festivity but then also experiencing the colder weather of the higher mountains but also the too hot weather of venice which we walked across to visit the art biennial and then also experiencing heavy summer storms and some rain before going for a longer walk and sleep over a rifugio in the higher mountains finding both a lot of clouds to walk across and some morning sun before going back down to our mountain shelter and experiencing heat once again"
