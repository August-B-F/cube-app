"taking my time to execute this illustration bringing some hope to our young characters undergoing quite a tragic period to at last reach this sort of giant mama sculpture symbolizing a portal to another world still with the sculpted head as separated from the body and with all sort of warning animals but also the monkey and the elephant sort of protecting the brother and small sister resembling slightly my upbringing with my twin sister but also my daughter and younger son as i have experienced them at the time this illustration was executed"
