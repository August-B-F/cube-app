"still in new york city following my girlfriend to some sort of an expo at the old and decadent site of a previous world expo park in queens and being quite revived of the presence of latino immigrants with all their street food culture and trashy vibe also later finding the same vibe exploring manhattan and ending up on a weekend day in central park finding once again a bit of the same festive and decadent scene later making it back to the misery of east cambridge where our apartment was and trying to save money covering long distances with my son to buy cheap grocery only later discovering how my wife was piling up the money she would get from sweden to be abroad and just saving them reproaching us for every penny we would spend"
