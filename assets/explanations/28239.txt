"spendoing some days with some rich curator students who intended to do a documentary about the building of the project museum getting them to help me cut the grass all around it and then left alone working on the more hardcore setting of the rocks so as to make a more solid foundation for it having now received a second and more official permission to move on later also receiving our dutch friend mathijn and singing at first songs to the children and then letting him get out all his genius playing music at chris' restaurant and with little livia observing the gathering of the clouds up the novegno mountain to later spend some time with elise beginning to weld the ground floor of the museum and later taking a break with the bad weather and a lot of wind in our mountain village to resume the work again now building the middle floor with also august coming to help from sweden"
