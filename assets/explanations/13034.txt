"meeting my biological father for the first time in a quarter of a century in montreal and exploring the city with him showing me the places where we used to live with my mother and my twin sister but not really wanting to film too much not to disturb his narration and make me look like a weirdo but walking also the hills north of the city with a nice indian summer beginning to colour them and getting some shots of the city from up high prior returning with almost no stops to boston and there still exploring the north east of the city but also keeping it in the center bringing my son to many playgrounds andlater also bringing the family to the irish neighborhood to the south enjoying the beach there but generally getting quite in love with the new discovery my son and i made of the old and quite imaginative mount auburn cemetery all the way to the west"
