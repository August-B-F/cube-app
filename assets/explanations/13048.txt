"on our way back to boston climbing with alessandro mount greylock in honor of thoureau and then returning shortly to cambridge leaving our nice life there to make it to the colder sweden but this time finding the family already installed in an apartment in the beautiful aspudden south of stockholm really enjoying the proximity to nature there taking often little august around to the city and along the vinterviken to the trekanten lake where i got first in contact with the city and then further on to the city feeling rather connected to the weather and with still glimpse of summer only making it once to uppsala and other than that keeping happily in the stockholm south exploring also much nature and getting nice shots from the top of the granite monoliths"
