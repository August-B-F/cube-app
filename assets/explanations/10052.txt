"at my new work taking portraits of a few new colleagues but really not compromising my professional situation and keep a bit of a distance to them and thus as i would not friend them on a social media profile i also don't get in to photograph them but instead being out at a gallery event in the boheme part of town and meeting up with old friends and the danish artist working really hard on her animation piece and getting really moved of my compliments but also a special dark hair swedish who has been hiking with his australian wife down to odessa and doing very spiritual work in nature and then also a young and a bit naive london painter aside for my colleagues like my office mate roman from ukraina who is quite a nice fellow and a russian girl speaking italian and quite an athlete when it comes to cross country ski but even the lesbian maria who is a empowered feminist and dresses with all very femelish stuff for sure getting a like of it but also getting a like in being totally open minded and telling me of all her masturbation time thinking of her professors and in the same lines the austrian based italian artist valerio who got a projection of a slick comedy on his naked ass and revealed himself later to me to be homosexual this along with a super boring and naive and plain swedish curator who i will meet even later without recognizing him"
