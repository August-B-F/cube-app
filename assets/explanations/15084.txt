"a month with clean air to begin with in holland taking nice bike rides but then breathing some bad air painting the outdoor furniture and later driving to breda in a bit of a traffic but lastly going to sweden and talking long walks there in the city breathing quite some pollution particularly one afternoon with a gathering of old american cars and another afternoon walking out to the mall and breathing dust from construction works"
