"some pretty nice days alone outside in the sun walking and feeling most good but also some low energy days going to work and then be in my ex apartment attending to her house and my kid with whom i also had some very nice excursions in the city and some nice time even here in the south of town walking and also quite nice moments meeting up with old friends going to performances and even doing a performance with goralski who brought some energy despite the depressing gray winter weather"
