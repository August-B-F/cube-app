"a rather hard section of jogging with the winter on the way and the snow and at first a very cold weather which allowed me to run on the parking lot of an abandoned warehouse in front of my nw apartment but then with the ice and the melting snow i did went out to run once and felt a bit of a fever and concentrated to train indoor at the university gym instead where i finally discovered a step machine which i started using for my running as it does not have a motor and i can increase and decrease the speed every two hundred meters although it doesn't not allow me to go either too slow or too fast giving then rather moderate values"
