"listening to the music being played repetitively in mikael goralski studio in stockholm and then also while trying to pay off my taxes in uppsala but also spending time with august looking at him playing video-games with some songs being played in a mafia related one and then back in the netherlands singing the usual songs to livia and listening to her now learning to sing back but also listening to the playlist i created with oldies to listen in the car for example on the way to rotterdam"
