"a pretty clean month spent also quite much out despite the winter finally kicking in but bringing quite a clean air overall and little traffic even in the stockholm city where i often ended up with little myrthe and really only breathing bad air while jogging in the snow free parking lot with several trucks coming by or finally traveling to the netherlands after a long period and smelling the airplane fuel but getting a quite mild and very fresh air down in maastricht walking on the hills"
