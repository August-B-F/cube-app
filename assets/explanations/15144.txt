"a month with clean air still under the lock-down to curb the pandemic and with not so much traffic but also making it by car to walk on the dunes near haarlem ad experiencing quite some traffic with people trying to have a nice weekend despite the state closing down all parking lots and towards the end of the week resuming to weld the textures of my museum this time using a fume aspirator but not finding it too effective and still inhaling some fumes and at last purchasing a gas mask and welding with it only perceiving a bit of fumes at times"
