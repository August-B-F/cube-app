"recovering from all the toxic work as a carpenter building mainstream exhibits for the big museums in the netherlands and stepping down from such work becoming more critical at last getting back at least part time to my previous life with my kids bringing them to nature and making them happy spending also many day renovating the attic at home and thinking of what to do with my project museum whether trying to do it again in the netherlands or try to pursue it back in italy"
