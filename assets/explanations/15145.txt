"a month keeping quite a lot outdoor running out of metal to weld my textures and dedicating more time taking my kids for walk in nature driving to different natural reserve but always getting in a bit of traffic also experiencing some traffic in the our small city and mostly otherwise breathing good air but when making my mosaics breathing a bit of dust even if i am wearing the mask and later receiving at last my shipment of metal from china and beginning to weld it together feeling the need to put more ventilation in the shed and also find replacements for the filters of my protective mask"
