"after a whole summer stalked by hunters coming to harass me during the building of the project museum finally receiving the first enthusiast visitors like an old couple and the grandson of a rich industrialist who has inherited a contrada turned into a villa below our contrada and later also visiting one of myrthe's colleagues near my native highland where her mother is from getting to know her nice side beside all her feminist and politicized entanglements at the art academy and then on our way back driving through germany meeting the chinese couple who sold me the mosaics to make the project museum and back in holland meeting an italian woman at an utrecht playground with her kid not speaking one word despite his age and also a young artist from the academy making very flashy paintings"
