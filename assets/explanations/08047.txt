"a story inspired by a little duck i kept seeing with august when walking into town by the river and being most amazed by its physiognomy and also by an actual drunk who shared old muffins with all the other birds but somehow never feeding that duck i later found out to be called a sculpt and being also quite impressed about its diving features and the fact that they are typical of this vikings region and the very river where they used to transport their bounty into a hidden island"
