"working in the cathedral valley alongside with vito and his friend lucio cleaning it up from all the wood very thoroughly and taking care myself to load my tractor with timber and then also by hand download it in vito's field next to the road and working hard now feeling a little untrained after a month in the netherlands mostly walking and not training my arms"
