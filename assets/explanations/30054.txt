"discussing the presumed inventor of microchips federico faggin also born in my region in italy yet being rather critical about the idea of wanting always to discover and invent more for the sake of capital and also feeling critical about the designer bruno munari so much making fun in his life about artists and mostly hailing designers like him improving the social life of people but at this stage hailing more artists like dziga vertov truly creating a sort of empathy with a reality most traumatized by scientific inventions and the sort of warfare they bring about"
