"a month working very extensively now having been told not to continue with my installation and visiting trento with my in-laws and also walking a bit more up the mountains to finish off the work there before traveling alone through germany and walking extensively through munich and later walzburg and the smaller but nicer wertzone and the fully reconstructed and modern dortmund before traveling back to the netherlands and resuming there my walks with livia both in culemborg taking advantage of the nice weather and crossing utrecht as well as walking in rhenen and other small towns by doorn during a long bike ride there"
