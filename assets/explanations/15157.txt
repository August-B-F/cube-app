"a month rebelling against working in the dusty and unhealthy carpentry at first building some fancy tables for the rijks museum getting quite congested with the dust also made by my colleagues coming to help me towards the end at later mostly working in a convent in utrecht setting up and exhibition there and not really being exposed to any bad air to then go back to do more tables and closets for the company with more dust and some hardcore bad air some screws in the epoxy coated pavement of the former building at last quitting the job and just spend nice days in the open with my children breathing the fresh air of our village"
