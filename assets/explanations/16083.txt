"driving from the netherlands to sweden going through all sorts of weather and at last coming to a really beautiful djursholm where i spent my time with august enjoying the sun and only experiencing one day of bad weather before leaving again for the netherlands through an awful rain and finding quite a warm weather there and some cold weather later going with myrthe to the east of the country where she had to work at a museum only finding nice weather there after trying to be out in my morning run"
