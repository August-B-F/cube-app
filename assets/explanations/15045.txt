"pretty good air quality aside for a couple of days where i for instance walked with august along a big a trafficked road in stockholm to reach his mother and then also another experience of walking by a busy road with myrthe while in rotterdam trying to get around the city otherwise finding the air rather clean both in sweden and the netherlands and even not so bad in the airports now experiencing a clean wind blowing away the planes' emissions and not even feeling too much the pollution from the nearby factory while staying a lot at home for the winter weather even though towards the end it was sunny and i being doing gymnastics in my little park inhaling good air"
