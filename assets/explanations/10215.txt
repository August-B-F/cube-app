""a bit of a sad period working at a very low wage as a carpenter in the netherlands after the continuous attacks of politicians and social media users in italy sort of giving up my hopes photographing other immigrants from greece and latvia working in a cheese factory at the birthday party of my daughter's classmate and also right before finding some strength and dropping the work also photographing my colleagues at work such as a nice kid my oldest son age who worked a lot and for no nothing and a nice zealand guy with possible french huguenots origins with who i have built many a furniture and an austrian girl also throwing her life a way in the dutch company and a chinese guy with an artist background totally wasting his life enslaved in the vicious cycle of cheap labour"
