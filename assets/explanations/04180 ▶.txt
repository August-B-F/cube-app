"feeling at first very happy left alone with my children traveling back home through the enchanting austrian landscape and stopping there to enjoy the nature but then finding it hard to readjust to the urban life in the netherlands despite having my old friend davide visiting and despite going daily out with him for walks and bike rides and canoe rides just feeling a bit empty left alone with now also my youngest son silvester having to attend school after so many years together but in the end recovering by becoming very disciplined with my project and also with myself getting back to running and training"
