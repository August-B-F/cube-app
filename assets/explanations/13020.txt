"still in china now venturing for some sightseeing with my family often as the only non chinese going now to the near suzhou discovering the beauty of classic chinese architecture and roaming with little august and his mother far and wide in the city not really visiting any of the private parks also later going for some days to an island in the the near of shanghai but finding it quite depressing and even taking a lonely walk alone in the night not really being able to depict the landscape there at last to return to our usual spots in the south of shanghai with a warmer and spring like weather going often to parks with august but also to a quite ugly monumental park wanted by the comunist party and taking august's grandparents around after they came to visit now almost exclusively keeping in the remote nature within the metropolis"
