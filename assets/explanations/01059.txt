"a period pretty much caving in my uppsala life despite having an exhibition in stockholm and spending some days mounting it but also building a prototype of an inflatable chair reacting to energy consumption for an american designer who really believed in me but still getting more and more caved in our new life disconnected from the capitol with the snow making it even harder to commute to my life there still finding some poetry taking my son in the woods just behind his kindergarten to grill our wursts and enjoy some nature not really connecting any more to his grandfather's countryside place after our fight"
