"a last month spent with my children before starting to work as a carpenter and enjoying our time together in our dutch village doing many small adventures before setting out to provence with the whole family and there every week going to different destinations taking walks and exploring the beautiful landscape radiant of a most bluie sky before confining us back to the netheralnds with the children starting school and me work in closed environments and even having no time to update in the morning anymore and writing my journal entry as i used to in the evening starting with today and no longer with yesterday"
