"still building on my show-room in my tiny swedish apartment and later taking lonely walks recording my thoughts and also seating on the sodertalje shore to write a journal entry before thoroughly rethinking the cupola of the virtual cathedral to deposit my project and then staying in avesta to attend a department conference and in my room checking for casualties on my phone using world news app and then filming a walk with jacek still taking advantage of the nice spring weather"
