"an apparently irrelevant lecture talking about my old mountain neighbour rino and his frugality but also how at last it got hospitalized possibly disabling him from ever going back to his life in the mountains and telling about how i could resumed my cathedral idea in one of his fields not so much to glorify power but really going quite against it after much struggle as also experienced by emiliano zapata despite his quite successful attempt of a self-governed commune and laso in this lecture looking at other landart realities like in belgium with much works reviving the whole limburg but finding in the character of the south more the passion for self-building and dedication as in the cathedral of justo in contrast with all the power build up wanting sovereignty and more authority of the law"
