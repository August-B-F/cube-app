"a weather started in a very bright and sunny stockholm turned really cold but still very sunny walking my kid to karate before going back to the netherlands and find a warmer temperature beside one cold and gray day spent in harlem exploring the surrounding forest and then experiencing mostly a quite nice and warm weather allowing me to spend quite much time outside building a bike shed and to walk a bit by the river going a bit beyond what i had previously explored"
