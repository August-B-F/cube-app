"now living in the old swedish house i renovated with such passion for years and only going for some days to uppsala to clean up our apartment there before selling it and in the countryside continuing pretty much to paint and fix the outer walls of our red house in the hope that my wife would let me use the attic to build a small museum with my project but not really getting any help from her in cleaning up all her stuff following a bit in despair and feeling an increase urge of wanting to present my life work some how and commit to building something for it"
