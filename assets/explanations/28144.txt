"month spent in our place in the mountains with myrthe getting back to the rural life after many years on the road and observing clouds with a local friend and then feeding a small kitten and writing in my journal outside also working on old gianna's vegetable garden ad even trying to keep up with our laundry the old way before finding out to be completely invaded by ants in our kitchen"
