"struggling to be outside now working full time in the carpenter workshop but trying as much as i can to take walks during my small breaks and at least stay outside to experience at times a powerful wind turning slightly more gentle to the end of the month but also cold making it hard during my free days with my kids to take walks especially on sunny day on top of a dike with a small chilling breeze making it too hard for my kids to withstand but later experiencing almost no wind and a good moment to be out especially in the last weekend"
