"a quite cold beginning of the summer in holland with some rain and just occasionally some heat mostly in the early afternoon but also hearing some thunders and one day of really heavy rain before leaving with the children across the cold northern part of germany at last reaching a quite warm bavaria even camping outside and enjoying the perfect weather later crossing the alps and getting almost as if in an oven with an extreme heat making me rather concerned about climate change in general also up in our mountain apartment with a more tolerable weather and the extreme heat experienced going down to schio for errands with both the kids turning completely red and sweaty"
