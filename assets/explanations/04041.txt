"feeling not really at my best going to the seaside in italy with my kid and being quiet down in mood from the beginning but then recovering very well also with myrthe and have a nice time all together to then move back to sweden and just getting myself really busy in the peak of the summer and having myrthe home spending some pleasant moments despite the rain catching up with our moods and having to readjust again going to my native village in the alps with august surprisingly negative about all the walks feeling a bit disappointed that i could not give the best of my natural heritage both to him my son and myrthe my girlfriend with whom i might have had expectations to spend more time here in the future but finally also here readjusting quite well after a beautiful day rollerblading all the family in the beautiful valley along the brenta river and experience catharsis in the night of ferragosto dancing with both myrthe and august in a mountain town square before departing again from my love and my mountains"
