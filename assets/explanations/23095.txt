"going now in details explaining how my childhood was a childhood of blood and violence from the very moment i got baptized but later after i was forced to move to a city down the mountains things became more quieter until i moved to nordic countries and experience the passive aggression of these more civilized people i actually fear far more than those who can just directly express him or herself with me also seeing how nationalistic they are becoming and reflecting instead from a more aristotelean point of view how the manifestation of a certain degree of rage which is by now banned can in fact diminish the sense of superiority of others especially of potential new gangsters or aristocrats"
