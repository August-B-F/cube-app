"a month with an extreme amount of work in the barn in the alps setting up both the archive as well as the viewing room spending most of my time there isolating the ceiling and dedicating a lot of time to paint it all white and beside that doing minor works in the garden helping myrthe to plant flowers as well as building a staircase with the leftover chestnut wood from the old ceiling and a big table but also taking a few walks"
