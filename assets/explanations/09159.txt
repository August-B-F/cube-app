"walking very often with the coming of a nicer weather but still at first having the kids with me and feeling unable to formulate my thoughts also later with livia at school and still silvester to push on the stroller till at last managing to talk a long walk alone to the train station and then from delft city center all the way to the landscape park where i thought of building an installation and finding quite a peace to get in tune with my soul as well as with the solar dutch nature around me"
