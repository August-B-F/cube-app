"experiencing some ok weather in the mountains but then having to be locked in the apartment with a terrible snow storm in the middle of the spring and experiencing later some cold wind while working on my installation making it difficult to weld and then again a day of powerful wind and rain before going to milan on a sunny day only experiencing the wind channeling in the high buildings and finally coming back to the netherlands with a much more pleasant weather yet some wind making it hard to bike"
