"quite a poetic month spent with the children in the mountains enjoying our time together letting them play in the fountain and getting in touch with the nature there and the hundreds of sheep but also managing to resume the work with the project museum building the first floor and being quite hard working also taking care of the children with cooking and bringing them to bed only getting some help in the morning for a few hours by a girl just out of high school"
