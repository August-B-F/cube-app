"almost getting out of the dark scandinavian winter keeping up with our rather happy life in stockholm doing quite a few home improvements at home like with the loft bed i built and keeping with training regularly but also teaching at the college of art and design in town doing much electronics and only towards the end making it more out to nature with some sunny days resuming the small traditions i had with my son to light a fire in the forest in the lidingo island and roast some meat together"
