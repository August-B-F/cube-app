"only managing to take a nice walk with the kids in the south of rotterdam following myrthe there to assess one of her students doing an internship and then having to keep in our village with the pandemic kicking in again and a total lock-down being imposed but also spending much time cutting metal and welding it in preparation of my museum in the alps and reducing my time walking around to only when myrthe is working and i have the kids thus not really taking trips in the weekend but staying home"
