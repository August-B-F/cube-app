"pictures of vito who was one of the few people who really had a heart to help out in my adventure in the mountains building my museum with him almost from the start offering his help to begin with cleaning the valley below the site where i built the project museum and later giving me a most valuable help in setting it up along with my son august and later davide especially setting up the structure high up and anyway always available to help and finding also that we are originally from the same highland and have pretty much the same inclination in taking care of the landscape and dedicating ourselves to it"
