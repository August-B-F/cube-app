"a month spent entirely back in sweden mostly doing activities related to my thesis preparation like reading and writing which brought little actual physical activities also made less by the replacement of the camera made to make the films of public spaces and the phone to annotate my ideas and the shapes of the clouds and also the dictaphone to record my thoughts all replaced with a smart phone which reduces the amount of objects i then photograph while being outside despite now also wearing my sunglasses which in fact adds an outdoor activity but other than that only doing a little bit of physical work to clean up the room for my new italian room mate riccardo and also limiting now my activities in the apartment because of his presence but otherwise being very constant to go to the gym"
