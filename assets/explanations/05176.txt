"a month back in the netherlands with quite some nie spring days but nonetheless walking quite little mostly spending my time out in the garden to make space to a laboratory there and going almost every day to bring and pick up Livia to school with the kids using their steps or their bikes having to be very careful about the traffic and not really venturing any further but to gouda taking a small walk with the family after purchasing a more economic second hand car and to wourden where i walk with the children fetching a second hand newer laptop there and beside that walking in tiel after our visit to the notary there parking the car out of the paying zone and once going with the children in the cute buren walking a bit around there despite the cold snowy weather always adapting to their strength"
