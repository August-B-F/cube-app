"updating on the discussion whether to include or not the prefabricate metal nets to the museum after showing the textures to a dutch composer friend who saw them as ugly and anyway a trend in stage design and the arts and also discussing the idea of archiving content within the museum but more as a ritualistic element similarly to ancient burials like those of viking ships like the oseberg but discussing also how contrary to it there is no national pride that can be derived from my work and generally discussing the museum as the attempt to being the digital immateriality back to reality to get it ready for another trip to an after-life type of immateriality"
