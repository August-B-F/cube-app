"very clean air to begin with while in holland often biking from culemborg to other small villages but then reaching italy and finding a dreadful traffic in vicenza and later going to the mountains to build my archive using a smelly synthetic paint and cutting wooden boards with much formaldehyde as well as impregnating the structure to put the gyps panels and also breathing in the isolation while all the time being ventilated by the fresh mountain air"
