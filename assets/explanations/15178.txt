"traveling with my sons through europe experiencing some traffic especially in germany intensified by the heat and many trucks but then having a good time at florian's place and also in switzerland breathing fresh air before making it to the overheated flat land of northern italy with a lot of traffic in the little bergamo airport and then keeping in the mountains with the clean air there welding a fence for our new parking lot behind our barn and also finishing it off with a concrete ramp always protecting my mouth and nose at the project museum also beginning to polish the inner pixels prior to positioning the tags with glue getting a throat pain but despite that taking nice and refreshing walks avoiding the heat and keeping with the family high up"
