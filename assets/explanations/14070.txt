"in the old prussia getting inspired by the soviet cities but particularly again of all the flight and airplanes i had to take to then reach my native alps and getting many ideas there from the natural landscape but also in a roller coaster theme park where i spent the day with my son and his mother to then spend a day on an hot beach of lake garda getting quite some ideas there with all the people sunbathing and from there back to the less inspiring life in sweden where the harvest time had come"
