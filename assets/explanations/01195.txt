"a month spent almost entirely in our town in the netherlands with the corona virus outbreak sweeping through europe and at first forcing myrthe to calling sick and then experiencing the actual restrictions imposed by the government and taking advantage of the restrictions to do work in the garden and on my project thus also seldom changing places and taking far less pictures than usual not even going with myrthe now also doing all the grocery to avoid me getting too exposed since i don't have a health insurance yet taking much care of the kids starting to feed little silvester and often giving him the pacifier to make him asleep during our walks along the river with also nice spring days coming out but the beeping feedback of my camera stopping to work making difficult to understand whether or not i took a picture"
