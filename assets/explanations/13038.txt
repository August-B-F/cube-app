"in boston walking extensively despite the snow but enjoying the sunny weather and taking my kid several time with the sled down the hill in the common but also in playground mostly walking west of cambridge east and sort of never returning to the same place but always finding and discovering new spots in the city until a sudden change traveling with the whole family to puerto rico staying near the old colonial city in a run down neighborhood and visiting the city with my family getting some nice scenes with the sea and the fortified hilly landscape but also keeping it on the beach and into the not so nice nearby parks letting my son playing there with local kids"
