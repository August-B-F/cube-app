"feeling a little sad far away from the project museum in italy and trying to readjust to my new life of a daddy here in the netherlands also at last moving my address here and getting a bit depressed by all the bureaucratic procedures to do so but getting quite some nice days taking memorable walks with the kids with some nice sun only to be hit by more and more negative comments about the museum in italy and later by my mother and her family attempting to sue me to avoid having troubles for the things i say of them as part of the project"
