"a quite intense month spent in the mountains welding together the museum textures in a neighbour's garage before starting to set it up with august and a guy his age organizing the installation quite well having to drive both him and his sister maria up and down the mountains with the latter babysitting livia and silvester yet still having to make it to the contrada to change the kids diapers and putting the little one to bed but making it the most out of the few hours in the morning and the few hours in the afternoon to complete the outside of the museum yet with myrthe back in holland being unable to draw and also being unable to have the time to fully update my project with silvester being very demanding and in this month also having a few accidents like one almost losing my life flipping with my tractor trying to bring the textures to the museum"
