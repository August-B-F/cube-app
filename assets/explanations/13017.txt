"after much exploring with liselott and little august discovering a nice old part of hangzhou but recording at night with not such a good camera and soon after flying to kuala lumpur venturing in the not so nice city there just trying to get a picture of the various places before traveling to a small island on the west side and finding a small spot not so strict as the other muslim places enjoying our time there and exploring the sea with a canoe filming also more remote areas even venturing across the island on foot getting almost attacked by wild dogs and monkeys in a damp at last making back to inland malaysia exploring there the not so interesting cameroon highlands with its tea plantations but a lot of mud especially trying to hike with my family never able to really come to any interesting views with always the vegetation covering all the heights"
