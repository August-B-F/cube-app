"mentally connecting more and more with my reality giving up all the possible distractions such as my short-lived social media activities to promote the project museum and also people trying to involve me in other projects mostly for themselves and always unpaid like the guys running a restaurant on top of the novegno mountain but also loosing my friend davide as an intimate reference with him not really engaging anymore and anyway taking a different path in life feeling sad about the event but either way feeling glad of my choice in life to invest in making a good base for my family but also for my work and also feeling very happy meeting up other people living in the village such an indian italian family and also feeling very happy just to take small walks with my family taking a break from all the building hours i put on the new garage having silvester at times giving me a hard time as he got sick towards the end but with livia now becoming a most well educated and kind little girl"
