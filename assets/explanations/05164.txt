"again a month spent welding the project museum textures but really making an effort to go out as well taking the kids also to stroll around utrecht finding the city most empty due to the pandemic but also increasingly more luxurious and later trying to go to more authentic places like walking in the forest after once again replacing the gas can of my welder on the other side of the river and also taking a walk in the near of the linge river this time also with myrthe exploring some new paths across the spring blossoming fields and also at time feeling the need to walk more beside the usual rounds in our dutch village making with the kids to the industrial area to plan the shipping of the project museum textures to italy and after over a year making it at last back to amsterdam with the easing of the lock-down to join the protest against the bombing of gaza making an important walk from the stadium to the city center also several times going to delft to explore the field of landart park where i could build an installation"
