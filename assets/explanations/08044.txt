"story started in berlin while hosted by a gay couple and yet inspired by the cicadas found this summer in the italian sea side leaving their bodies attached to the trees and also much of the story then really much inspired by my situation in academia with the professors imposing their canons and somewhat demotivating the students which i wrote after some time and on a different notebook thinking to have left the previous notebook in berlin where i already once forgot some drawings but also concluding the story in a way by reversing the moral of the usual cicada that sings and than die in the winter not being hosted by the ants now having the cicada overcoming the diligency of the ants and even affecting the work of the ants once his singing is no longer heard"
