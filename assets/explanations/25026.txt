"working in frankfurt to install an exhibition and in my free time visiting the city walking extensively through it with only a pause of few days visiting the house of another artist in the south of germany getting to appreciate the landscape there and then left alone in frankfurt after the exhibition taking long walks on each side of the river encountering some interesting urban realities"
