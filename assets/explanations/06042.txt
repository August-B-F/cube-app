"slowly getting back to run after a long summer with a lot of walking in the mountains and feeling the need for some movement buying at last a proper watch to measure my heart beat with a band attached around my chest and being able to go for longer runs both in utrecht by myself and a few times with myrthe for very short runs in which she often stopped and at last also running in the forest behind august's house taking advantage of the nice sunny days"
