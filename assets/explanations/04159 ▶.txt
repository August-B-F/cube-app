"a period rather okay at work but starting to feel quite burnt out only getting better during the short christmas holiday and getting mostly disturbed then by the architect in italy unwilling to proceed with the building of the staircase and the floors of the project museum spending hours early in the morning trying to figure out what to do and at last just giving the whole idea up feeling much better and feeling only better after some days spent outdoor with my family returning later to work but finding quite some energy going there with myrthe's electric bike"
