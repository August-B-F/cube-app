"with this panel reaching exactly half of my project with exactly half to go photographing my right hand and living now completely unnoticed as an immigrant doing a low paid hard job serving cultural institutions and getting to use many tools to build at work but also getting quite tired of it being kept most of the time in the very noisy and unhealthy workspace trying to be as much as possible with my kids otherwise but being often stuck home due to the weather and really seeing in the panels the days with little tools spent at home or doing small excursions with the kids later also in the short christmas holiday going into a lock down with the coming back of the pandemic and working on the attic of our house using old tables to make one big table in front of the window and starting to put plaster boards all around the wall"
