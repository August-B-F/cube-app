"filming the time spent with my kids discovering a nice area by the dunes in holland and filming the animals there but also showing the arrival of the metal pieces from china and the arrangement i made to weld them together to make the textures to cover the project museum in the alps and after recording a section recording my thoughts crossing amsterdam making it to the alps and filming a walk with my kids there waiting to have the time to work on my museum"
