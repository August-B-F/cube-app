"catching the commuter with august all the way south ending up in a nice swedish shore assisting there and wounded duck and later making it to holland and recording a section of me training in my favorite utrecht park also checking some clouds in the city and in breda at myrthe's mother doing some writing in the living room and then spending the evening checking out all photos and then going with the divorced father the day after to check a modern art museum in belgium doing a bit of filming there"
