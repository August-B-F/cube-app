"a troubled month feeling at first really solid despite august getting quite moody as i do not have the money to pay him right away for his work but then making it up and just dedicating myself to the family and taking walks at last facing a very furious myrthe trying to make her happy again but in the end slapping her causing her sudden departure from the mountains with kids living me alone first with august feeling very sad about the situation but then slowly recovering and also making peace with myrthe having at last time to take care of the venice apartment and later of the barn doing work i wanted to do for a long time only feeling a bit blocked at the beginning but then succeeding well and feeling sad to have to leave for the netherlands with a cold and rainy weather awaiting me there"
