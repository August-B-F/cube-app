"still exploring and filming the obscene soviet reconstructed city of kalingrad with its ugly monuments and collective housing later to make it to the nice and less bombed coast enjoy the time there despite the military presence and at last returning to sweden only to go on holiday with my family to my native highland again walking really a lot up the mountains there and only for a few days traveling to the gorgeous garda lake beginning to be very nostalgic of the south of europe and most terrified of spending more winters up north"
