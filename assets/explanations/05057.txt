"a lot of walking with the warm weather being in northern italy and exploring with both myrthe and later jacek and brett a lot of historical places like verona and venice and brescia and bergamo but also fabulous natural sights like the island of the iseo lake and some valleys and mountains below and around my native highland being very inviting with the sunny weather at times and then coming back to sweden and only walking to enjoy the arrival of the snow and to get some work related stress out but mostly stopping to walk and keeping indoor"
