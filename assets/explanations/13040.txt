"walking very extensively in boston now with the snow melting and taking my sone to many playgrounds but also out for several excursions going both south to the nice arboretum but also taking the commuter west to visit the small and beautiful towns around where the american transcendentalist thoreau grew up getting quite a nice vibe about such rural landscape and back in the city exploring more of the downtown and pretty much having always to get back in the afternoon to pick my son up from school and with him explore more of the playgrounds mostly in cambridge and towards harvard"
