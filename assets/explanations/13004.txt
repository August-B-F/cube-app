"month of filming beginning in uppsala with quite some snow making the city a bit miserable and filming also often in similar places like picking outside august primary school and outside the swimming pool to suddenly fly with the whole family to northern italy and from there travel by train all the way to rome filming the amazing places of the capitol before going to perugia and filming the surrounding with the camera unable to handle the strong light at times yet managing to get beautiful views of small medieval towns like gubbio and the surrounding mountains so beautiful it broke my heart to go back to the misery of the swedish winter"
