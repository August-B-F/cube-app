"still filming in ravenna the old basilica there before the local gypsies robbed us of all our luggage we left in our car including my laptop but not the cameras i always have with me and at last making it to mantua and filming our walk through the city there with myrthe on the phone trying to see what to do about our stolen things also visiting some alberti's architecture i am so fond of and later keeping in a house in the country filming of our biking around and looking at clouds having in the end to use my cellphone as my computer to my journal"
