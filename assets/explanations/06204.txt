"still fatiguing in provence carrying the children on my back along with myrthe and climbing up the ocher mine in roussilion and later also walking fast with silvester and livia on my shoulders in a forest north of dijon before making it back to the netherlands and there beginning to work as a carpenter fatiguing almost daily throwing trash and dismantling big exhibitions for the main dutch museums but also building and lifting pedestals"
