"a month spent traveling with the children through europe all the way to our mountain apartment in the alps and very much focusing in schooling them on the road especially while walking explaining them many things and only at times getting some thoughts and recording them but always having to be careful about them and entertain them also in the mountains taking many walks with them but having to fully focus in stimulating them to walk up the challenging paths nonetheless also keeping up my reading of bakunin and having some thoughts related to his idea of state"
