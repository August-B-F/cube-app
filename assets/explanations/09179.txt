"recording thoughts while spending the summer in italy mostly finding some time walking alone up to the project museum to work on it but also in abruzzo taking walks on the beach letting myrthe enjoy the sea with the kids and other than that taking many more walks but always in the company of not only my family but also friends coming to visit such as florian and mathijn having not opportunities to record my thoughts also feeling quite congested about sharing the making of the project museum on social media reflecting at times on this topic at last also giving up all that sickening sharing"
