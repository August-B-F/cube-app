"a month working hard on my girlfriend's farm in the near of uppsala both looking after the cows bringing them over to the farm to drink in the evening and also taking care of my vegetable garden watering it regularly renovating the potato basement under the barn awaiting the potato harvest and going occasionally to the forest to pick blueberries especially for my birthday cake eating at times at my girlfriend's parents but several times baking my own bread and cooking our own food"
