"a quite unstable month trying to do welding outside with always some wind interfering and at last setting up a new shed where to do my metal work and feeling a bit afraid that the wind might blow it down but also experiencing some days with less wind and taking small walks with the children avoid days with quite a weak but cold wind till at last experiencing days of a warmer but strong wind with the kids almost unable to walk but having quite some fun"
