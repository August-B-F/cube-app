"a no longer so cold weather with the temperature oscillating around zero and then no longer the bright icy days of january but a constant homogeneous cloudiness which has lasted almost throughout all the period but the very end when at last there has been very sunny days and a sudden warmth making everything so pleasant and nice as an early sign of spring with all the snow now melting away and far longer days, turning everything more tolerable"
