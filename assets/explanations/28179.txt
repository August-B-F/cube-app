"living my last period in sweden in a campsite getting to film my writing fables with still some light in the evening sky and later also my waking up and experiencing the sun rise having breakfast by the lake before also getting august to spend time with me in the camping and with him checking out the animals there in the end also going around with my parents showing them the city and experiencing the wind and back in the netherlands recording mysel observing clouds and finally after dropping my post in the too politicized swedish university dedicating myself in my new life in the netehrlands to catch up with the illustrating my ancestors history after years of not really having a home or place to do so"
