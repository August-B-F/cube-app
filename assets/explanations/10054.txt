"again traveling to russia this time by boat and landing in saint petersburg for the first time and like a gogol character or turgenev wondering the city rather than the country and meeting a bit of characters like a guy selling hats and a too soft canadian couple to then go back to sweden and meet at last two really cool young swedes to which i sold my office chair as i have been in the phase of divorcing from my wife and needed money and really discovering how cool certain people in sweden can also be like a guy making digital art and another who has lived as a street musicians but both ending up doing standard jobs and so also meeting a more pretentious greek swedish artist but kind of experienced with some new york living in the background and some theory to distinguish him from the standard educated swedish artists like an old woman i met at a far away opening who is up to ceramic making and really had a bad breath till at last meeting the colombian cousin of ivan at a small party"
