"experiencing different mood in india first getting a bit down feeling captivated in the ashram of a big guru with many westerners full of mental problems but finally feeling relieve going to the ocean and swimming and walking despite the shortage of money and having little food to eat and sometime davide traveling with me being a bit negative but then being in tiruvannamalai and getting energized by our walks around the holy mountains there and later traveling to sweden feeling rather stable and giving a lot of energy to my students and to italy telling many nice stories of india to my parents and getting a bit moody readjusting with myrthe but at last getting a nice welcome from my mountain folk and a sunny winter weather"
