"camping in france with the family getting some good air walking on the northern coast with always the family around still having some moments to also record my thoughts even back in holland now fully occupied with my brain in the writing of the anarcarkist manifesto and sort of reproducing the same thinking in my recordings still never really alone and with alway either the kids along or just the uncomfortable feeling of dutch people listening from their tightly built houses"
