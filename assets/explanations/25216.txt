"trying to do small excursions with my kids with the arrival of the spring and some warmer weather and visiting several natural reserves by taking photos in a swampy environment at first and then on a more desert environment by the beach where my camera got a grain of sand under the delete button so having later to delete duplicate photos i took especially after spotting with my kids a hoard of deer but also with them taking photos in the near of our village still with animals portrayed but also people working on the many house renovating projects as well as some military vehicles and just people enjoying the nice weather before some cold and snowy weather setting back in"
