"a very nice swedish summer coming back from the italian seaside reaching the pick of the heat but anyway not really enjoying it being mostly at home doing carpentry work to receive at last myrthe in my apartment but then having a most dreadful raining weather and no possibility to bike together at last going back to the italian alps but finding also there the temperature a bit colder but nonetheless quite fresh and nice on the sunny mountain tops and actually only experiencing one single day of rain in which we took a walk with august in the clouds and then finding the sky most clear and the further dolomite very visible"
