"still being quite at home with the winter and avoiding the university so spending quite some time painting and keeping up the previous painting with the green grass and the yellowish background but this time making a circular subtraction in the middle without really any usual surface color but experimenting much with different colors mixed on the panel trying to reach different shades and feeling like this painting is really an in between painting of two other paintings compressed as it is by the diagonal shapes on the sides and also playing with apink semi circular shape not really paying too much attention to finish too well the boarders"
