"a month period started in the very windy city of malmo and then continued over to stockholm experiencing a lot of wind particularly going by bike and being more or less exposed by it depending on the landscape and getting a lot of wind when biking with myrthe and august on our way back from an anthroposophic institute and during august's birthday when the weather got really dreadful and we tried to walk out but got some frozen wind welcoming us and finally getting to the netherlands experiencing some wind there despite the lovely weather and finally back to always windy malmo walking to the university with jacek and being quite exposed"
