"films of public spaces shot during a beautiful autumn spending quite some time both walking in sweden mostly in and around djursholm and the beautiful water side and the netherlands filming my tiny beautiful town of culemborg with the beautiful perspective of the main square as well as the beautiful forest of breda but even the urban environment like in amsterdam before going back to sweden"
