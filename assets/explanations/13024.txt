"making the best out of our stay in shanghai with our time there running out and still going much in parks but also visiting more of tourist attractions such as the old city and part of the world expo before actually traveling to tokyo and even here mostly going around alone with my son august with his mother at all times in the hostel not being so impresed of what remain of the old part of town trying to reach the parks as in china but finding completely a different scene with many homeless people queuing for food mostly in the near of yoyogi park where we spent many days"
