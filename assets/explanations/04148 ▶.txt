"a period feeling quite nervous probably due too much work on my project spending too little time walking around as usual and with the kids being rather intense getting quite affected by livia's moods but also managing to do nice excursions together lifting up the spirit and starting to miss my oldest son august quite a lot with the pandemic still keeping us apart as much as we had to keep apart from all other friends and relatives only improving my mood walking with the kids especially as silvester did not wish to sleep so much anymore in the afternoon"
