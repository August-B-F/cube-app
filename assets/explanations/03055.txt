"much eighties and nineties hits heard on the corridors and in the bathrooms and in the hallways and shops of a russian cruise during a last trip with my ex wife and son to then be rather isolated and music less for sometime other than gypsies street musicians also dressing up like santa claus and playing christmas songs or a choir in copenhagen singing the usual santa lucia but then also in the alps in italy hearing christmas music broadcasted in the square of a beautiful small town"
