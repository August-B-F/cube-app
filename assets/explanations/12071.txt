"news mostly collected in utrecht using my girlfriend's wireless connection but also during a summer school in coventry england and at the airport reading the news from the papers but even on the night news in the terminal monitors finding out of a big deadly flood in india and using my mother's mobile phone at last at the sea side in northern italy reading more of the bomb attacks in iraq but mostly overall finding a lot of deadly accidents in more civilized countries like a big train crash in canada and an airplane crash in america all causing very little casualties however"
