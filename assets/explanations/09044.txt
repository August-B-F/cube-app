"quite many recordings of thoughts now after a rather long period having no possibility to walk alone and being really thoughtless but this time i had several possibilities to record going out with my bike and finally be able to reach nature from my industrialized suburb but also walking through it in the middle of the night and recording on my way to myrthe with and also while walking by lakes coming back from my son's apartment and feeling a big need to breathe the autumn air and think about my situation at the university whether i should seek for more autonomy which has been also the issue of my walks while in berlin going early morning to check a spy tower station or walking at sunset in the orangerie of potsdam"
