"new acquaintances met now still living my life as a bachelor and going with my colombian student ivan to a performance festival where i met a crazy body artist from the north doing dangerous stuff with broken glass as well as a turkish student who was a bit obsessive but also meeting two great theater actors from montenegro that has facilitated a very nice workshop on improvisation and a german girl studying to be a curator with whom i tried to collaborate but never managed and finally people from an art fair for nonprofit galleries like a polish guy and a very nice austrian woman curating artists from morocco and quite a shy gallery assistant from south africa"
