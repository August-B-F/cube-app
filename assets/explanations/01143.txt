"a month started in our new house in the netherlands suddenly feeling quite depressed as i did not manage to do much work with the bad weather and all the furniture inside but nonetheless managing to plant fruit trees and starting to build the bike shelter outside and then going to sweden and doing a lot of cooking and cleaning not only for august but also for jacek and brett and at last coming back to the netherlands resuming my work building a missing wall in the kitchen and dismantling and mounting a big closet in the bedroom"
