"a painting started in the summer in my ex wife parent's farm in the house i have renovated among all sort of furniture and boxes packed in the dining room awaiting to be moved to our new apartment yet being unable to complete the painting in such chaotic conditions and with all the demands set on me from my ex wife's family and all the work required from them to clean up the attic of much of their trash but finally having to wait to move to my new studio/apartment and there at last being able to paint over the details of this painting which again shows this dropping mass over a more colorful background and a fluorescent spot which should be behind the mass but comes out with its irradiation plus a oblique cut which is some sort of grass mountain like terrain over a more burning like sky in a diagonal which is more of descendants than a ascendance"
