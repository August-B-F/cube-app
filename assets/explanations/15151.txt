"a period of clean air having finished all the welding of the project museum and dedicating myself to the renovation of our barn in the alps plastering it outside and also going down to venice to finish freshening up our apartment there before making it to my family in holland finding a gray and cold weather but also a very fresh air only with some occasional traffic in the more industrial area of our village and quite a lot of traffic going for a small holiday in dusseldorf"
