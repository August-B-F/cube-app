"a december dark month spent in sweden with quite a drastic decrease in the amount of objects used spending quite some time at home in our stockholm apartment beside doing the usual swimming and training while spending quite some time playing with my new harmonica recomposing my whole heritage of songs as well as getting quite much into drawing only spending little time in the countryside during christmas going out with my son to cut wood just with an ax and an old saw before making it to my native land in italy spending some sunny days there with also quite some ice and snow"
