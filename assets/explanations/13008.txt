"having a easier time filming with the summer setting in and documenting public space in stockholm before making it to italy and filming in venice while hanging out with my friend davide and my american curator friend jason waite before taking more solitary explorations of my vicenza while visiting my parents and seen for the last time my beloved grandfather now confined in a retirement home and filming also the beautiful scenery around it before exploring with davide milan and discovering the beautiful cimitero monumentale there at last then returning to the more dull swedish landscape"
