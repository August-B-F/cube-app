"an intense month first waiting for the material to keep on building the project museum and taking walks with the children pushing them in the stroller up the mountain to our friend chris and alessia or even bringing them both in my shoulders making a small round in the novegno mount and then receiving the gratings as well as the metal bars to build the project museum floors downloading and loading them several times at last bringing them with my small tractor to the project museum dealing alone with those thousands of kilos but also feeling good and sporty about it"
