"quite a tough month coming back from the alps and finding a beautiful spring in holland but then getting the whole family sick and having to take care of them as well as beginning the production of the project museum tags keeping rather much at home also finishing to cement the garden path i made using old bricks and in the evening reading a lot of che guevara as well as drawings and writing a lot becoming quite disciplined despite having very little hope to get anywhere with my project but understanding it now more as some sort of a diary and playing out the role of my subtle daily struggles"
