"finding some energy at work doing quite some physical labour but at one point feeling very bumped about the situation with the project museum in italy feeling like to sue all the folk at the municipality who have completely withdrew their support to save their skin and later finding back somewhat of a balance trying not to think about it and giving it time spending instead some nice days with the children considering also whether i should still work full time"
