"despite all the distress caused by my supervisor situation at the university attempting to get a new one feeling much love and intimacy with little myrthe on my side doing several small adventures together and then also trying to focus at home on my own art like painting and drawing in order not to think about work and really getting stronger also conducting the research my own way and doing a lot of other art work like editing videos or at last setting forth with learning how to make video-games with august but then feeling rather distressed of traveling to the netherlands and going to a mainstream museum and lastly becoming really happy of our staying in maastricht exploring the nice nature and enjoying my first sun in weeks feeling much love for myrthe"
