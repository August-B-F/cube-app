"a restless wind with the changing of the season at times getting really powerful like in my day of departure from cambridge and then being back in sweden spending quite much time outside like during myrthe first visit there kissing on the heading rock of a small island and then also being in utrecht with her and at times experiencing almost no wind but mostly always some wind even though generally not so powerful"
