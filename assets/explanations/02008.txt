"a month still dreaming about both my italian family and my new swedish family and related places but increasingly having more dreams about school environments and generally students and more specifically about my old estonian director and my new american director ronald jones from the design academy in stockholm but even dreaming quite often about my old art professor ernesto luciano francalanci who so much influenced me in my art and often also having quite scary dreams with me falling or being chased probably also due to film watching or simply going by bike down hill"
