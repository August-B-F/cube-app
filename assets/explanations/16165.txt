"possibly the worst spring in decades in the netherlands with constant rain and only a few hours of sun at last experiencing some nice days just on time to pack the car and the trailer to travel to the italian alps and find there a cooler weather but somehow less humid and in the long run very pleasant especially compared with the heat in the plateau below and always in the afternoon hearing thunders from the mountain above us or in front of us and giving up welding in a neighbour garage so as not to compromise my equipment"
