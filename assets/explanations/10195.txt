"still people met while with august exploring the den bosch carnival and getting to know more or less some jolly folk but also a few playing a bit the aggressive type and then back in our dutch village meeting an italian friend of roberto who has invested in a luxury alcove in amsterdam to rent to tourist but feeling not so interested about these sort of lifestyles and at last meeting wouter at a playground letting our kids play together and discussing about his activities in the entertainment industry never really getting from him any input or help in thinking about my project museum in italy"
