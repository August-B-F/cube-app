"inhaling bad air to begin with in sardinia traveling to sassari through some traffic and later taking a tourist boat with a diesel engine to visit the maddalena island and back in italy experiencing heavy traffic in vicenza on my way there to pick my passport and finally some good air in the mountains working only occasionally with machines to weld and cut the metal for my cube installation and using the trimmer to cut the grass in the valley below it and beside that only inhaling bad air visiting cities like going to bassano and again to vicenza"
