"making a big effort to take walks spending wait too much time at work and even being forced to keep in the workshop as i need to leave on time to get my kids being denied to go to locations in museums and so making it impossible to explore places as i did before during my break but once doing some preparation work in utrecht and taking small walks around the workshop during the week and with my kids making it a point to walk during the weekend exploring once the downtown near my work place walking up river and trying during a free sunny day to walk on the waal dike but finding it too cold for them ending up walking in tiel and really enjoying ourselves with myrthe once also walking in den haag exploring the allies bombed down neighborhood to the north but also walking in culemborg mostly trying to get my head back in place and even taking silvester up stream during a rainy day"
