"filming myself observing clouds while in our little dutch village of culemborg and then also in the village checking out myrthe's little boy growing in her belly and then doing much singing to livia at home alone with her but also listening to the music being played while at the birthday of one of her cousins in utrecht and back in culemborg observing the wind taking a solitary walk and then filming the playing of our neapolitan friend franco in a local cafe ultimately updating the editions part of my project"
