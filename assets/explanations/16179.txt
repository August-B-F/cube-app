"not such a warm weather while in italy often having to turn the stove on and then traveling through a very cold austria only to find germany warmer stopping in a stuttgart with a most beautiful weather and a hoard of migrants celebrating by the river later also finding quite a nice weather in the netherlands taking even my children to swim but being in the end secluded at home with them and their mother falling sick for a long time with the weather also turning colder and rainy"
