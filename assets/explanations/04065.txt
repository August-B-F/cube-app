"a month starting feeling really bad with my mother doing very bad propaganda against me and generally cutting me out but then feel nice to be reunited with myrthe and not so nice about all the parting around her house but finally tuning very well with her and nice conference people to at last going to frankfurt feeling very good amount mounting my installation but not so good about having received little press coverage and at last feeling very happy at the opening with all the other artists"
