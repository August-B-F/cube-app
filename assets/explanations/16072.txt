"real gray and boring november weather in sweden but then going to the netherlands to find a nicer and crispier weather which also allowed me to go and run but then also experiencing and heavy storm driving to a small airport in germany and finding a beautiful sun while with august in his island followed by days of snow and a more interesting weather in stockholm with several sunny days allowing us to go for small walks and enjoying the few hours of light"
