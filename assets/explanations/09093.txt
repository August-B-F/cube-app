"recording thoughts now while in stockholm walking around the empty streets and reflecting on the good impact i got from meeting artists with their precarious yet inspiring lives and also later taking long walk in uppsala on my way to august walking up and down small and big rivers thinking mostly of my situation independent and with time to work artistically and without so much commitment in society but working out an alternative to it"
