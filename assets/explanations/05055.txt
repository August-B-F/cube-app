"a month characterized by not so much walking as the autumn has being a bit wet and i spent much time at home even though i did travel to the netherlands and i did manage there to take some nice walks first with august around utrecht and the to rotterdam taking a decent excursion by myself and later with sweet myrthe who joined me but then no other bigger walks were made other than a bit in the southern suburbs of stockholm and in stockholm with august and by myself but also with him on a nice day walking up a little cliff overlooking a lake"
