"the starting of a new life now writing about my days mostly spent no longer roaming around with my kids but working for a dutch company building exhibitions for the main museums in the netehrlands and narrating a bit of my life also demolishing these exhibitions and getting into some sort of a fast culture industry nonetheless keeping up my discipline and mostly worrying about my kids trying to spend all my free time with them"
