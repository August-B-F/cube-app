"filming a rare snowfall at the end of the winter distracting me from my work setting up the metal workshop in the garden and spending time with the kids pushing them on the snow before taking a long walk in the dunes near harlem with silvester and also filming quite some wind with the winter not really wanting to go away but at last filming the coming of the spring and my being out taking care of the kids showing them the awakening of nature as well as filming my hard work writing the accounts of my project and appending them to my website finally filming once again the wind while with the family in den bosch"
