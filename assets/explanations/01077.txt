"still spending some time with my chinese old friends especially in fuxin park and then leaving shanghai for good spending a wonderful time with august in tokyo being very playful and checking out the very different and less rigorous but also more wasted japanese city culture going to a lot of shops just to play with things and making it to parks soon however returning to sweden and there keeping in the countryside deciding this time to finish liselott's postdoc in boston and just spending our time in sweden preparing eventually to move there still not really doing any of the countryside work i was so committed to in the past"
