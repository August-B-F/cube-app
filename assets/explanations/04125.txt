"a month now spent mostly with my family in the mountains missing august and working less at my installation getting quite negatively affected by the hunters revolt against it but soon finding strength and happiness in creating the content of my project alone no matter where and if its cubic container will be built and also finding some good energy setting on the road through germany and in the netherlands missing my physical work but taking very nice walks as well as being very much helped being very productive feeling rather immune from all hunters revolt as well as my mother"
