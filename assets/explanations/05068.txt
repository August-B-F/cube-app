"a month of intense walking aside form back problems started in my trip to the netherlands where i walked both alone and with myrthe in utrecht but also went with her father and girlfriend to gent mostly following them around and at last also walking a bit in breda prior going to italy and exploring the east side of the iseo lake looking for a land to buy and making long stretches also from sale marasino where i stayed and sulzano where the agent was walking both an ancient roman road on the hills and the trafficked road by the water to at last come back to sweden and take small nice walks with august particularly in the anthroposophic center of jarna and at last taking a long walk alone in gothenburg but also with myrthe walking particularly close to the nice area of jarntorget prior going back to stockholm where i bought a van to sleep and work on my italian land but that i also plan to use to explore the surrounding and drive to august without having to walk too much through the city"
