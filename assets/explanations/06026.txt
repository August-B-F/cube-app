"now running quite regularly in a step machine in the gym waiting for the ice to melt outside and getting a time a bit distracted by the music being playing at the radio or by the other doctorate girl training and really not being able to go full speed as the machine starts moving around getting quite dangerous but at last finding the parking lot by my apartment almost without ice and making use of the nice weather to go run again feeling in fact quite fit aside from all the seating and standing which gets a bit painful for my knees"
