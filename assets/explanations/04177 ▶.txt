"a month again spoiled by our dutch military neighbour threatening myrthe so as to be allowed to put isolation for his wall but on our property side but generally getting to sleep good and training a lot biking with the children to the lake to swim and only having to face myrthe's anxieties but either way then feeling most happy about august joining me in the netherlands and with him travelling to sardinia also there getting most happy to reunite with my old friend davide but finding it hard with august wanting to keep in bed and in general not talking but managing to take nice walks on the beautiful gallura's coast"
