"a very sunny period but with a cold wind to begin with and as the temperature got more summer like feeling quite relief from the constant but never too intense wind only reaching a bit of a peak during few not so nice days but then keeping rather light and even allowing me to bike on dikes and generally just spending a lot of time at the river with the kids at times with no breeze at all"
