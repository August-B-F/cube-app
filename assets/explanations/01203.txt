"a month with relatively not so many pictures taken as in the other months perhaps spending too much time outdoor and not so much indoor cooking and taking care of the household but nonetheless keeping up with quite a schedule of updating my project early in the morning and staying with my kids throughout the day to then resume the working with my mosaics in the evening and also getting more active in the afternoon with livia on my side while little silvester sleeps and draw and prepare the mosaics for the casting having little objects sometime in use given also the fact that i spent many hours on the computer developing the interface for the mosaic retrieval"
