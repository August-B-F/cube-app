"digging more along with august yet unable to make my heart beat watch working properly and attempting to wash it and at last buying a whole new watch without chest sensor but finding it completely unreliable only producing a graphic without delivering any data and now only willing to use a more proper watch especially hiking up with august in a pasubio valley searching for edelweiss flowers unable to properly record any heart beats"
