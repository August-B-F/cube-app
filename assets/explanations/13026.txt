"still more days spent in uppsala mostly with my son but then also traveling alone to stockholm to try to get an english exam for a phd position i got in australia and staying at my artist friend mikael gorlaski taking my time to explore once again the city before returning to uppsala but from there also exploring more of the surrounding borrowing my parents-in-law old volvo car to go to lakes and bring my son to swim but also for many walks"
