"left alone now in the mountains with myrthe going back to the netherlands stying with august and the kids working on the cubes during the day and taking care of them during the evening singing to silvester his favorite soldier songs during bed time but also driving up and down to pick up their baby sitter listening also to quite some songs later going to my mother at the sea side and for the first time being horrified on how out of tunes she is with her singing and very limited in her repertoire"
