"a month inhaling very bad air cutting bricks to fit a new door in myrthe's house and making a lot of dust and then finally taking a break from renovating enjoying the late winter weather but also mixing off and on cement for minor works and removing all the isolation from the attic to at last breath some bad air flying to sweden and there mostly breathing the fresh cold winter air with some traffic of the expensive cars mostly next to my son's school"
