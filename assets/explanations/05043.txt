"after all the walking during the winter holidays and in krakow where I was mostly going from meeting to meeting and considering the problem of my left knee i walked considerably less this month also because of the very cold weather and the flu but did manage to walk to do grocery for my kid and his mother on the mall along the railroad and took my kid a couple of times in the city mostly around a park where i used to take him when he was little but also did manage to walk at last on a beautiful day on a frozen lake and make it on top of a small mountain there"
