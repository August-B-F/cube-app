"a period spent in the netherlands pretty much investing my money there buying equipment to get my project museum going and traveling with the kids to places to choose for the right machine but also spending much time with them letting them play outside whenever the spring weather allowed it and also outside keeping up with the building of a path using the old bricks we found under the ground floor and beside for it being rather disciplined with my project and finishing to read fred uhlman novles and generally shrinking up our life and concentrating it around our dutch house especially with the ukrainian war hitting the european economy and daily life"
