""pictures of the mother of my high-school best friend francesco meeting her through the years especially in my native highland where she came to spend the holidays with her husband in a small apartment and always finding her very kind and loveful especially compared with my cold and loveless mother but just a times too intrusive and expansive and generally not so thorough despite all her many travels and cultural interests but still very amiable especially with francesco and his sister and their children"
