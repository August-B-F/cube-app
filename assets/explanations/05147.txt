"taking several walks always in the netherlands with now a better weather and also my kids seating both in the double strollers crossing utrecht a few times with them and mostly otherwise walking in culemborg and only taking a long walk alone in rotterdam waiting for a meeting at the art academy there exploring the west of the city finding an abandoned railway to walk on but then getting back to culemborg and having to keep it there with a lock-down of the city given the coronavirus outbreak and at this point keeping up my walks with the kids mostly in natural areas avoiding busy places"
