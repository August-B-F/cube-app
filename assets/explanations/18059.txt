"a bit of a turbulent month with quite some wind from the beginning doing qidong outside the university and then experiencing light changes biking alone outside of sodertalje to finally get quite some wind with the changing of the weather and the wind bringing even snow and followed by relatively low wind spending much time inside coding my video-game but at last experiencing a lot of wind walking through Amsterdam and seeing cardboards flying around but finally experiencing quite little wind back in sweden"
