"a month working intensively on the production of the textures of the project museum also now able to plan our recent trip to italy and feeling quite happy about it having still some energy to take care of the children during the day while welding early in the morning and late in the evening often then having to go straight to bed unable to follow up so much my readings and only occasionally during the day going for excursions if not related to getting material for welding such as spending a whole day biking to get a new gas bottle and towards the end sleeping too little but still finding the energy to keep up"
