"reading the news regularly every morning and at times watching the evening news but really once again finding certain news taking over all the minor ones which i accidentally read or hear from minor channels so reading several days about the air crash in ethiopia and the islamophobic shooting in new zeland but almost by accident getting to know about sinking killing migrants in morocco and the zimbabwe cyclone and so forth"
