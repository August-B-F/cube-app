"traveling with august to sardinia and having there some time alone to record my thoughts talking long walks along the beautiful coast at times being left alone with also my friend davide busy editing videos and august wanting to sleep long during the day and then also traveling with him and my youngest silvester through germany and switzerland taking occasional walks and at times taking a bit of distance from them to record"
