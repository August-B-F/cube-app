"making back up north after a sunny carnival holiday spent in italy and already getting hit by a much cold wind in germany but then finding a most pleasant sunny period in holland with little wind and a very good time to try to fix our backyard situation dismantling the old sheds to make a nicer one in the back and in the end getting a much stronger wind experienced on our way to livia school and back with much of thin rain turning us completely wet"
