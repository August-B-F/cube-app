"a month started in the netherland still working quite hard on my project following up to myrthe's working rhythm and thus working much on my computer but also taking breaks and going camping with a canoe but particularly doing activities related to biking and then going to my parents' summer place in italy and there doing consistently many activities relating to the beach such as putting sun cream or playing beach ball or simply ball with august and myrthe or putting my new sunglasses on and drinking from plastic bottles but also doing quite some cooking in the unusual bad weather and taking small breaks by car to explore a bit of historical places and being quite active documenting them despite having to pay some attention to august and myrthe and at last being robbed of both my smartphone and laptop thus depriving me of the possibility to update my project in the last days of vacation"
