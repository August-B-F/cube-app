"still a rainy summer hindering me and my son to be much out but then getting my best friend francesco to visit us with his new girlfriend elena and bringing them around the countryside with a period of nice weather and even making it to dalarna going with them for quite some hikes but again with a bad rainy weather setting in at last making it quite depressing for august and i to be in uppsala but nonetheless discovering some nice places during our walks in the forest and filming not so much paying attention to have him in the camera also going quite often with him to playgrounds"
