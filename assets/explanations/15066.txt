"relatively good air quality breath in frankfurt while walking back and forth to the exhibit and also visiting with florian his house in the south of germany to then be back in sweden smelling the dust of trucks cleaning up all the grouse from the winter roads to then travel both to italy and later to london smelling a lot of traffic there and feeling very unhealthy walking by the heavy traffic and completely getting back to fresh air again staying with august in his apartment"
