"dedicating my free time intensively to weld the texture of the project museum yet nonetheless taking advantage of some sunny days to do excursions with little silvester while livia is at school combining it with picking new gas or new wire for the welder mostly on the other side of the river in the hoge veluwe exploring both the forest north of amerongen as well as the forest south of veenendaal and waiting for good weather conditions to go with also livia for a nice walk and making it once more to noordwijk walking with both kids without stroller through the dunes to the beach and there together walking along the sea all the way to the village and back through the dunes and beside for these explorations also taking nice walks with the kids in our village and when livia is at school venturing with silvester across the fields and along the river and only in one occasion taking a walk by myself at sunset to clear up my mind"
