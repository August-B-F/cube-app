"enjoying some a bit of an indian summer in uppsala and filming around our new neighborhood and in the city also venturing quite far with august all the way along the fyris river to the malaren lake but then having to commute quite a lot for teaching in the design academy in stockholm and filming also inside these semi public premises getting to film towards the end more interesting spaces such as the view from the viking burial ground west of uppsala both in a nice day and later with the snow falling turning the landscape quite white and finding right in the landscape a sort of aesthetic to pursue"
