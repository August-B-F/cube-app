"rather clean air back in sweden with always buses and small traffic in front of my apartment whose windows are open because of the summer and also due to the much renovation work I did using paint and other a bit chemical smelly stuff and much traffic at time encountered in the stockholm city center which is completely under renovation till at last getting to italy and inhaling a bit of the airport pollution but mostly in my native village of asiago getting quite congested due to the ferragosto holiday week and being myself with august and myrthe quite exposed to it driving with my mother's car otherwise breathing the super clean mountain air having to go quite high"
