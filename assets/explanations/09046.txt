"thoughts recorded during the spring going to august or taking minor to large walks through swedish forests feeling quite puzzled as what to do with my future trying in this respect to be more independent from the university environment and also undergoing sentimental crisis feeling however strong of my walks particularly around the area of the tullinge lake even while carrying my bike down a steep cliff but also thoughts recorded during a very refreshing easter vacation in sunny italy finally rediscovering the hills next to my parents' place where i used to paint"
