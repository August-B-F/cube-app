"giving quite a dense update after traveling by car to the italian alps to give my first workshops in the project museum there and not only describing about the workshops with the very nice students from all countries using some laminated version of the tags but on top of it also relating about my impressions about the trip across southern east germany stopping in the beautiful and mentally reviving black forest and on the way back stopping in the absolutely beautifully positioned stuttgart and only commenting negatively how migrants in such countries seems to me only as a procrastination of a capitalism that is no longer sustainable also describing later back in the netherlands my progress laser printing the project museum tags"
