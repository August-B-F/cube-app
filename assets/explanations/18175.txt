"always some breeze and later quite some wind in the netherlands with the summer slow to come yet staying quite much outdoor also going with myrthe's electric bike not bothering so much of the wind in the end experiencing quite a storm also when traveling through germany with the kids finally to reach a most peaceful bavaria with no wind and then some wind crossing the austrian mountains and then very little wind and an extreme heat in the italian alps making me expecting some very extreme weather ahead"
