"a period finishing off all the welding of the textures i made for the project museum in the alps and also spending quite some days organizing and later bringing all the textures to a local company of our dutch village to have them shipped there and in this time getting my hopes up to also do some work in the netherlands using my mosaics here rather than putting them up in the alpine village where so many people hates me and beside spending much time with my kids with the weather however not allowing us to go far and only once venturing alone in amsterdam to take part to the protest against the bombing of gaza but there also finding quite some violent behaviour from the side of the palestinians"
