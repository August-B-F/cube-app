"a pretty nice beginning of the month with a lot of good weather and little wind perfect for biking but then more of the usual dutch weather setting in with stronger wind now also making the first autumn leaves to fall and lastly a very powerful wind experienced in the evening before going to bed after showing the project museum at a gallery show in town"
