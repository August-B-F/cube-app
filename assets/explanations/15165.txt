"a month giving up the building of my project museum in the italian alps and taking a lot of walks in the open air with only a few days coating the museum with linseed oil and getting quite intoxicated with it also at the beginning using the air compressor powered by the generator making it more unhealthy and other than that only occasionally experiencing some traffic like when exploring bassano and later when traveling with the kids back to the netherlands"
