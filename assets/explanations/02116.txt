"a proliferation of dreams now that i am not traveling and i have been very steady both in my swedish apartment and lately even in utrecht with possibly also a light sleep due to my back pains which has facilitated remembering of dreams that have been often reminiscences of my time in italy both at the sea side and on the mountains with many ones concerning both my girlfriend and son but also his mother and professors at the university with a few dreams also related to being going fast and being unable to move or being taken by a woman i don't like"
