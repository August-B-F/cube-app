"a month intermittent with clean air and bad air inhaled first in holland cleaning up the chicken house and cutting many metal rebars but also biking often and inhaling the good air and then in italy feeling the polluted air in the flatland and then going in the mountains to plant small trees but also doing deforestation with the chainsaw and breathing the gasoline as well as rowing with my stepfather in the gran canal and inhaling all the boat traffic"
