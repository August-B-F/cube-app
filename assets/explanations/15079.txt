"a month started in sweden inhaling a lot of pollution walking from august place to the train station and then spending all my time renovating and inhaling the fresh cement of the new floors in the barn as well as mixing a lot of lime mortar and smelling some as well as using my chainsaw to free the garden of the rotten wood from the previous floors and exposing myself to the traffic whenever driving down for some shopping or driving to my parents in the polluted city of vicenza"
