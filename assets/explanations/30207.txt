"a long lecture showing my progress with the new garage in our backyard and generally discussing about property and why did i got in the end to be a land owner so as to be guaranteed i could have taken care and love what i so much struggled for and later also linking this discussion with what made me leave sweden showing in fact how now the nationalist party is winning and becoming the main party among actual swedes making again the claim quoting lenin and pasolini that the problem are not jewish or homosexuals or black people but the issue really is whoever is in power and we should find against any form of power rather than to let certain discriminated groups obtain more power"
