"filming of public spaces resumed after weeks spent in the mountains not really exploring and now filming with livia in mestre despite the bad weather and walking to the city center several times before going back to holland and walking there with her both in culemborg but also in utrecht reaching the parks where to feed her and change her and lastly also talking a nice stroll with myrthe home from work in den bosch"
