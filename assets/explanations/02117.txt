"a very dream prolific month with a trip to berlin where my fear for punks and performers got me again after many years to explore the causes of my dreams and give an interpretation with photographic material about what daily event has affected those dreams i find more meaningful to explain and also keeping small general notes about the most emblematic characteristics of the month production noting how i dreamed quite recurrently about small kids such as my sister's small daughter and my girlfriend's small nephew also being affected now by a lot of videoconferencing with my parents and the latter but also dreaming much with my old son walking and rehearsing our weekend walks to forests and museums but also being on a bike unable to stop and the autumn landscape that comes with it particularly the lakes where is too cold now to swim but still dreaming about swimming there hugging my girlfriend as we would make love"
