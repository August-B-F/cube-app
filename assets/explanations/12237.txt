"not spending too much time in general to read the news and only focusing on the first page of reuters world news too often however only reading about the talibans taking over afghanistan and not so much about dreadful events such an earthquake killing thousands in haiti at last also making it back to holland and starting the day also engaging with my new social media accounts i created to promote the project museum rather than going right away into the world news as i used to"
