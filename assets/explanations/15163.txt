"quite some car traffic experienced still while in our dutch village especially when crossing into the more industrial area and then also traveling with the kids to italy at time stopping in very jammed petrol stations and meeting off and on some traffic particularly crossing the brenner pass and once in our mountain village breathing all the quite clean air there and only once using old petrol to cut wood with my chainsaw soon switching to a good an expensive petrol making far less fumes and using also my trimmer to open up the path to the project museum later also beginning to weld the first floor there and using a mask without aspirator getting quite intoxicated soon after using the full mask with aspirator making me breath almost entirely pure air if not for the fumes of the generator which i have anyway turned towards the outside"
