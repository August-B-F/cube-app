"public spaces started to be filmed while briefly in holland before going to the alps in italy and there not moving so much due to my intense renovation of my barn but managing to film while walking with myrthe and her friends and later august in the mountains taking nice shots particularly from the pasubio despite some problem with the now two years old smart phone that kept restarting and also filming different water sites where i took myrthe and august to swim as well as my native highland of asiago before setting off for a trip with august south filming the city of ferrara"
