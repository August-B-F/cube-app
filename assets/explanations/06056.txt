"biking to begin with with brett going quite slowly and reaching the pretty town of buren and barely reaching the heart beat to call it a training and then also bike with myrthe to dell and down to geldermalsen biking at a decent tempo and at last taking a long break from training traveling to scandinavia and then to india but at my return taking out the bike anyway despite the cold temperature and biking upstream finding quite some energy"
