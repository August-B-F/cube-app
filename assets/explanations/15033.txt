"a period characterized by much pollution inhaled first on my trip over christmas down to the north of italy landing in bergamo and walking to the center from the airport inhaling much exhaustion gases and then also in my parents city taking jacek around and still breathing quite a bit of the traffic but then finally some fresh air up in the mountains from which i left to go to southern poland and find a totally stagnant air fully condensed with coal still used from soviet times to warm up many houses in the slightly depressed plateau where krakow lays and thus getting to breath that bad air with jacek really wanting to reach a monastery out of the city outskirt but then going to a much cleaner location in the small mountains of the alsazia region to then get back to krakow where the wind has blown and the real winter has sat in leaving a cleaner air yet still having a times to avoid the city traffic by walking from jacek's house to the center by the big river but at last coming to the totally fresh but icy cold air of sweden"
