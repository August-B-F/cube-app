"feeling great around myrthe and with parents reunited in madrid but then leaving again for sweden and being less happy despite some nice days spent with august and then jacek till finally being left alone for midsummer having also kicked lamin out and being most miserable also being the time away from my myrthe too long and having troubles to communicate with her till at last i made her to her place recovering my good mood even though jason came from an exhibition in paris and i started feeling poisoned about all the political trend in art excluding works like mine"
