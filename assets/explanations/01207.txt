"a month trying to be disciplined with my work despite myrthe working very hard all day and being left with the kids throughout the day still trying to take advantage of whatever time available to weld the textures of my museum but soon running out of them and focusing on editing my website and reviewing my project starting to write missing accounts and also editing videos for my website but then getting quite burned in my head and with the coming of the spring taking the kids more frequently out for walks making small journeys to the forest and the beach but in these days away from home making considerably less photos with less objects to be photographed and anyhow having no energy left in the evening to work on my project and at times doing that but getting concerned about the quality of the work done when i am so tired"
