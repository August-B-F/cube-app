"painting done during my short stay in the netherlands between a cold period spent in sweden and going finally to italy to renovate the barn and spending now little time painting the margins as well as now finishing the blue color having to cut the tube to get the remaining paint out before going to the netherlands and spending a weekend there breathing fresh paint but also the clean air by the river"
