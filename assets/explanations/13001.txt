"a first video of public places shot to begin with while in uppsala commuting often to stockholm to get my passport to bring my son for a holiday at the seaside with my mother and eventually shooting some places in her city in vicenza but then making it back to sweden after she treated us badly and there visiting the city of nykoping where we landed and then going for a very rainy camping holiday in the island of ï¿½land with my russian friend pyotr and filming several places but still not really knowing where to point the camera as well as whether to avoid including people in the video such as my friend but also later back in uppsala my polish friend jacek with whom we took a big walk to the countryside"
