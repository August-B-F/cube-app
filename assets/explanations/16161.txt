"a month started with freezing temperatures and a proper winter with snow and ice and at last some pleasant days going to skate several times and only within a week reaching almost summer temperatures with the snow melting and keeping in t-shirt for some days before once again the cold sat in but also very sunny days usually quite warm towards noon and just the weather getting cloudier towards the end but still in general without any rain"
