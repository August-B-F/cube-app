"staring a new period of my life now with two small children to take care of and their mother resuming work only a few months after giving birth but nonetheless having some time to work on for example my website making it out of the project museum textures and working at it with little silvester playing in his little chair or sleeping but also keeping with little livia like in a small farm near her cousins in utrecht observing the wind with the mill turning quite frantically and filming an event with little livia's parents and the albanian mother of one playing songs on the piano also in the evening filming some fable writing and the going to the carnival in den bosch with august right before the corona virus pandemic put a stop to our traveling to each other in the end again filming myself working on the pattern based new website"
