"a pretty windy beginning of the month unable to really go out but still venturing to walk along the culemborg river to record my thoughts and later also experiencing the wind exploring harlem but mostly keeping in my study only venturing out to pick the many walnuts the wind got down from our tree and at last experiencing a pretty decent period with far less wind and far less bad weather venturing to bike even in north holland"
