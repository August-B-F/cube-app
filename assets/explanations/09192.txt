"having a lot of thoughts daily but always spending my time with little silvester and myrthe still homesich from work making it difficult to record them also while in the netherlands feeling not so free to speak with constantly houses in the near of me even in the total deserted streets but then traveling to italy and in the mountains finding some moments of peace to record my thoughts while playing around with the idea of building more sculptures as part of our property generally however feeling rather emptied out by all the focus put on the writing of the anarcarkist manifesto"
