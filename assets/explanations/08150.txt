"despite feeling most tired in the evenings after putting the kids to bed still managing to improvise this fable and now focusing on the barracuda feature of attacking anything shiny and at last devouring all the pirate treasures to be found to then turn into the ice of the poles mutating into an ever more perfect sphere at last used as a cork to hinder the release of evil and absorbing it to fly out into space as a parachute for parachute as i called it to mix in the word barracuda at last turning his shiny skin into some kind of film negative recording his circumnavigation of the universe"
