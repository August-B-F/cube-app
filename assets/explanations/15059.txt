"a month with initially quite some clean air but then breathing a lot of the factory pollution out of my apartment in stockholm particularly during the autumn holidays spent with august and later breathing better air at his place despite the morning traffic with parents driving big cars to leave their kids to school and finally breathing good air while in venice only inhaling some of the small ferries pollution and later inhaling a lot of bad traffic air in vicenza particularly while going around with my mother's car looking for a land and having to go through small roads with big trucks on my way to the hills and the alps"
