"a month started in gothenburg graduating there from my master program and spending a couple of days living in the school before going back to stockholm and enjoying a sunny period often swimming out door with now liselott wanting to have a kid from me and spending quite some time together also renovating her country house using heavy machines to get all her father's motorcycle oil out of the old wooden floor and painting the walls mixing our own colours as well as doing some farming feeling depressed with some bad gray weather setting in and trying to run especially to the nearby island of lidingo to recover my energy also at last celebrating a nice midsummer at liselott's family farm this time inviting a lot of my university friends like brian from the states and blanca from mexico playing all the traditional games"
