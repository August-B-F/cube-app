"a month spent with quite good air coming from outside but cleaning up my apartment before renting it and facing quite some dust particularly removing the inner wall i had previously constructed and beside that spending a short period with clean air in utrecht prior going briefly back to sweden and taking my parents' friends for a refreshing walk to finally ending up in san francisco and experiencing already the traffic there coming out of the airport and later biking from sunnyvale to mountain view and back on busy roads"
