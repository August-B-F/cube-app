"a quite complicated period having to accept many new things like myrthe's social life and my supervisor imposing me a cannon and restricting my entire research plan which has generated a lot of distress but nonetheless having great days with myrthe again feeling happy about writing at her attic before meeting the supervisor and also after during our trip to berlin but also being most happy trying to be very independent and taking amazing walks in the berlin outskirts which gave a lot of energies till again getting my mood down in the sedentary university environment undecided whether to fight or let go to their impositions but getting at last to start the negotiations and also getting a hard time with august being most rebellious and unwilling to spend time with me"
