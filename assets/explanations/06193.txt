"a period with quite some physical work spent improving the shed i built to isolate the sound of my metal cutting and also carrying quite some bricks from a house under renovation and using them as pavement mixing the concrete by hand and doing quite some cutting of the wood i was able to recycle from the house also by hand but later feeling content about the shed and just spending more time with the family making love after ages to myrthe and then spending many afternoon taking livia out with the shed to enjoy the snow doing some exercise pulling her up and down the dike but generally feeling rather untrained and incapable of taking my usual walks"
