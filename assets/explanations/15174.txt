"a month not really moving that much with a most gray and rainy weather outside and only doing a bit of carpentry work generating some dust like helping an old electrician to install lights inside our new garage or building a closet for the children other than that only facing some traffic in the usual industrial part of town but also in the southern part taking the children to the city farm with the road around the town been most trafficed in the end also traveling with our van for the first time on holiday finding quite empty roads in belgium and then a quite deserted northern part of france only experiencing heavy traffic in the ugly city of boulogne where we spent a full day with the family walking up and down the modern city"
