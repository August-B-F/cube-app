"a last lecture made in the netherlands about to leave for my much contested project museum in italy and feeling i had little to say but then in the end talking quite extensively about my necessity to be on the move and describing the being on the move of che guevara in relation to that of cesar with his small army also struggling to survive and thinking whether guevara might have also turn into a cesar betraying his principles if latin american would have indeed follow up to his guerrillia and also mentioning in this respect the work of debray on foco theory being focused on providing a discontent that can lead to rebellion also later discussing about my focus on the larnax foundation and mentioning the city of larnaca in cyprus whose name also derive from larnax later also discussing the possibility of also hosting a small guerrilla of archivists but having to differentiate from those who are not so intense and use archiving as only a cool medium to do cute and uncompromising exhibitions like the work of the dutch artist elise 't hart i met and the more intense daily archival from different angles of more peripheral and struggling individuals"
