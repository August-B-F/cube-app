"more folk met while volunteering in israel like some northern europeans also traveling across the country but also folk met while in tel aviv unable to go anywhere due to the sabbath and at last hitchhiking up to akko meeting some israeli soldiers while camping with my polish friend jacek on a beach but also a palestinian getting quite upset of the fact that his relative lands were all expropriated by the jews and at last making it back to jerusalem getting to know a very kind hearted palestinian ironsmith giving me all sort of presents including a shirt he himself made and sharing with him the struggle of trying to keep in the city and in his house with jews trying to steal it from him and his family"
