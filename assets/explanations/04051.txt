"still feeling bad about myrthe not coming over but getting gradually better just having a slight melancholy within me and enjoying my time in italy taking walks in the nature but still feeling bad about distant relationships till at last i got settle with it and accepted my lonely life with occasional time to share with august and myrthe and concentrate with my own work which gave me quite some satisfactions feeling rather euphoric about the show-room i am building in my apartment despite also being rejected to the university of the arts where i applied in the moment of deep crisis with academia but now feeling most relieved with my new supervisor and the possibility to switch to ethnography"
