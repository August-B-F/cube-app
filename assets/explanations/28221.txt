""alone now in the mountains filming myself photographing the right hand using the tools to demolish a chimney that we never used and sucked in a lot of the stove smoke and then also filming davide and i setting forth to transport hundreds of heavy metal bars to the project museum to build its structure loosing several on the ways but finally managing to reach the high field and then also filming the route i often took walking the venice riva degli schiavoni from my apartment to the train station later venturing with davide to weld the structure together however getting immediately the response of my neighbour hunter who got most mad about the construction probably to conceal some illegal killing of birds and then also filming some archiving in the mountain barn with a rainbow outside and ultimately getting the surprise of a snow fall right with all the construction of the project museum still undergoing"
