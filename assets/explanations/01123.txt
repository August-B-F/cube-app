"a quite active month not traveling so often and seriously now archiving all the physical outcomes of my project in boxes but also spending some lovely days out enjoying the sunny weather and biking quite a lot even with august and for a whole night surviving as nomads and other than that spend time in utrecht with myrthe and there concentrating myself more on writing down papers for each part of my project and finding little energy going back to sweden but at last doing some major changes in my studio resuming the interactive wall project"
