"a month with a lot of readjusting to do having set my big room for rent and feeling a bit distressed to begin with to move to my guest room and later also feeling not so happy in the netherlands over christmas but slowly getting happier moving to my new house in the alps and feeling worry there about it but then having a very nice time with myrthe exploring around and feeling happy with one another later also feeling quite happy with a swedish artist friend over getting a bit scared of the mountain heights and feeling distressed about it overnight"
