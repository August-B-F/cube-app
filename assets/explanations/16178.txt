"getting quite sunny off and on in the netherlands at last also making it to the beach in noordwijk with the family yet still always experiencing some wind spoiling the weather and even making it too cold but in the end driving south and stopping in the black forest finding quite a nice sunny weather there and so on my arrival in italy but not so much in the mountains with quite some clouds and a low temperature at night"
