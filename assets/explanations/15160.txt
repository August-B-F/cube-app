"back in the netherlands breathing quite some bad air demolishing with a pneumatic hammer the bike shed in our backyard and later using the bricks to make an elevated path on one side using cement and beside that also getting stuck in quite some traffic checking for a new less polluting car and at last purchasing one with some days of quite good air especially with bad weather having to stay at home but then resuming the work in the backyard and also traveling more by car to look for a machine to engrave the museum tags getting stuck once again in some highway traffic"
