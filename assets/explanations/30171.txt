"giving an update about the mountain museum after finishing to weld all the textures around it and also talking about the constant attempts from the neighbour hunters to sabotage it describing my approach to just give it time and wait for them to die at last also discussing whether or not to have staircases inside the museum and sort of deciding to display only the works on the ground floor avoiding the more critical and the more numerical and boring works in the end also discussing the sustainability of the project putting more emphasis on the fact that it can now be contemplated in silence"
