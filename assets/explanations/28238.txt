"filming my life with two small kids with the corona virus pandemic now putting an end to any of interaction just keeping intimate with the family and letting myrthe in the attic to work while roaming around with my little ones experiencing the wind but then at home beginning to build the frame to make my mosaics with and for the purpose also building a shed for the casting of them in cement later bringing the children to an increasingly summerish nature singing to them and also with them in our favorite park in utrecht observing the clouds and then doing more singing with also our albanian friend mirsa and his kid tom by the river until we finally reached our mountain village in italy and there bringing the kids to the nature showing them plants and animals like a big herd of sheep ascending the hills"
