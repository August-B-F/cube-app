"spending for the first time very little days in the countryside dropping all together my projects and ambitions there only wanting to escape from the ungrateful swedish society and mostly staying in our old swedish apartment doing rather domestic works and when possible making it to the forest at last getting on a train to go for a more serious hike at the boarder with norway constantly hiking there despite the bad weather but getting to see quite some untouched landscapes later also spending some time in italy with my chinese boss and his family showing them around both in vicenza but also up to my native highaland and back in sweden going often to stockholm to prepare for our time in shanghai listening to all the proposal made by our chinese boss to set up a company there but feeling most cautious about it"
