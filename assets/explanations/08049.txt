"fable inspired by some hobbies i saw at the beginning of the summer during some very beautiful days in sweden and then not really being able to write so much having gone to the netherlands and finishing the story after the holiday back in sweden getting certainly influenced by my reading of memory wheels based on zodiac signs and also using a new laptop to retype the fable but having to adjust to it being the keypad under the keyboard often making me write in other parts of the text"
