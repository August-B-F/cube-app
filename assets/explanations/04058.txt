"a nice month with several exciting things like buying a new car and spending very nice weekends with august exploring the nature and getting the last autumn sun as well as spending a very nice weekend with myrthe in gothenburg despite feeling a bit disturbed by her friend renate and then also keeping feeling very happy about the new land in italy despite having a bit of troubles sleeping because of my bad back and finally really enjoying a car trip with myrthe all the way to the netherlands and feeling very cheerful with her but one bad day feeling shit for sleeping to little and being in the gray weather here alone"
