"an intense period feeling not so affected by all the negative energy surrounding the project museum in italy with my mother legal threats and the fascist propaganda against it but enjoying the nice weather here in holland biking and walking with the kids and also not getting so affected of passing completely unnoticed after announcing to have concluded half of my project but later sharing my work in a gallery context here in our village and getting to talk to hundreds of people about it and finding an enriching way to share it and really amaze people"
