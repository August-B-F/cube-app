"taking a small walk to begin with biking down to a lake in sodertalje and walking around finally keeping alone after a whole summer with myrthe and august and then walking during myrthe's visit despite having both to work but taking small breaks to go downtown and also walking a bit in stockholm but mostly by myself really enjoying to cross the entire city and later exploring the djursholm island away from the tourists and at last also taking a decent walk from my university out in the natural surrounding"
