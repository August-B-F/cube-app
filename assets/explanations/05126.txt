"a month walking quite intensively yet often the same path like with livia in the netherlands and in venice walking back and forth to my apartment or working in the mountains at my project but also walking new routes like in rotterdam before catching the plane and in padua on my way to meet my aunt and even biking to other cities like to den bosch and then walk there with myrthe and livia and with them also take a long walk in the dunes east of harlem reaching the ocean"
