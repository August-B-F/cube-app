"a rather happy month with very little moments of low energy despite the fact that it is my first christmas holiday without my wife and kid but really now having most glorious days with jacek and his friends after all the readjustments of my trip to poland and then a rather quiet week running around printing my works in krakow and eventually also having a good time with other friends but finally feeling rather exhausted of social life particularly on my way back to sweden and to academia where really i have been trying to be alone and finally found peace in all the philosophical readings for my new courses"
