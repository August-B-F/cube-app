"little walking resuming at full speed my activity at the university but also due to the unstable weather conditions and very little traveling aside for a visit to jacek in malmo with myrthe and august following him in his restless walk of the town to fulfill his gps walking project while i also had to take care of august and of filming so not really being able to concentrate and enjoy the walk and not really walking so much in stockholm again because of the winter stormy weather and the darkness but only waking once to reach august to the christmas market at his school"
