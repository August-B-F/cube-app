"experiencing some hot summer days in the netherlands but also suddenly a few cold days with even snow and then traveling through germany with a magnificent weather and for the first time this year keeping just with my t-shirt visiting several cities and then stopping for a few days in a sunny innsbruck with a lot of snow in the mountains all around and at last reaching italy to work on my project finding a much colder weather and only a few days of sun and mostly rain and even days with snow despite the spring"
