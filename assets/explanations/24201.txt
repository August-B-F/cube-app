"a quite sad month in a way back to my life in holland looking after the kids with people in italy raging about the project museum there and just living my simple life here removing all my expectations after attempting to try to export my work here and getting quite distressed about my mother threats to sue me if i don't censor out all the information i collected about her wrong doings as part of my project but deciding at last to go into a self-censorship once again and trying to focus more on my project and its execution becoming very intimate with my kids and taking advantage of a sunny beginning of the fall to explore the surrounding nature together"
