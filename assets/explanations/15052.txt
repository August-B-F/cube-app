"rather clean month with a bit of bad air inhaled biking but also inhaling some bad air going to the supermarket with all the trucks parked on the way and mostly keeping home and thus not being really exposed to bad air until i went to amsterdam for a conference and experiencing some traffic but overall a lot of fresh wind taking all the pollution away till at last being back in stockholm and breathing bad air walking to a gallery opening and then again flying back to the netherlands and getting stuck in a traffic jam on the way to a wedding but nonetheless staying in utrecht with very clean air there in the city center"
