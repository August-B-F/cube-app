"Songs heard still while at my parents' seaside place in lignano hearing a piano bar playing in a hotel and eventually going there to later also taking small trips by car with the rain and listening a bit to the radio but particularly to august singing for me nice swedish songs making me quite nostalgic and at last listening to the radio on the care traveling with myrthe first to ravenna and then to mantua hearing nice programs about old rock bands and asking her to annotate the songs for me or simply memorizing them while driving and she was asleep but also hearing the love songs she would sing for me"
