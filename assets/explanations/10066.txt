"faces captured while in boston mingling with academics from a conference like a too agreeable canadian professor but also a waiter there with greek and swedish parents and weird lady telling me to bike to her place along the coast and find a cave where to meditate but also another artist erasing all the faces of her dead father in the pictures she finds of him and a brazilian girl met downtown handing fliers to then go to new york and meet a very interesting pipe player in central park where i followed his sound in the wood there and an austrian political artist doing an internship with my friend jason to at last meet a nice man from vermont on my way back to europe"
