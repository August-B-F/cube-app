"a month breathing gyps to begin with plastering the walls in myrthe's living room and then also sawing the old steps of the previous staircase to burn it in the fire and later also starting to dismantle inside the chicken house breathing there all the dust but also going for small walks breathing the nice air by the river and in a national park in belgium despite all the traffic to get to maastricht from there and finally in sweden breathing mostly the cold and snowy air sleeping at the hostel and then in uppsala before traveling to denmark breathing the small airplane air"
