"ideas got with the beginning of the spring finally getting more out after the snowy winter and much time seated attending classes and taking now walks with august observing nature coming alive discovering a beach with beavers and getting ideas there but also still from lectures and time spent indoor and slowly also becoming affected by a new element in my life having found my love myrthe and traveling to her to enjoy the spring together but not really focusing on my project afraid of losing focus from her"
