"still a bit of cold weather also in belgium during and the netherlands but then going to england and finding a most amazing weather with the exception of only one day and also finding nice weather in the netherlands and a most amazing summer at the seaside in italy with much threat of thunderstorms from the weather forecast but never experiencing one if not from the distance and at last not having to worry about the bad weather like in the previous summers in sweden"
