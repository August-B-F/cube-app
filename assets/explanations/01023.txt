"a month started at the canaries with my parents biking with my stepfather occasionally in the high mountains but feeling the cold distance of my sisters with my son and her mother trying to keep also with them eating at the buffet and going to the beach but at last returning to italy trying to spend some time with my old grandfather bruno there eating breakfast together and photographing for the last times his tea cups that accompanied my childhood and then back in sweden and spending my time teaching on the west coast and working in the copper graphic workshop in the capitol making more progress with the presentation of my archival prints but also going often to the swimming pool photographing shampoos and hair brushes trying not to upset anyone around me in the changing room and at home in our tiny apartment building with wood a loft bed so as to save space and taking care of my young son feeding him and changing his diapers and playing with the weather now being gray and cold not really going to the countryside"
