"in the mountains now with the whole family getting frustrated a bit with myrthe fully sucked up by her work evenings and weekends included and the having to be at all times with the kids despite also having to find some time to get started with our life there but then slowly managing the new situation especially later with the help of a local babysitter and the coming of august from sweden together being able to begin the setting up of the textures of the mountain museum and feeling happy to also see his satisfaction with the hard work despite the people sent by the politicians and the hunters to block my project making me feel rather sad"
