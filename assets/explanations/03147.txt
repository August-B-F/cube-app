"still spending much time with the kids singing songs together or to them particularly to entertain ourselves in the long afternoons waiting for myrthe to come home and also singing with roberto some italian songs during his visits to us with little sarah and also hearing songs during cas' birthday in the forest house but then getting into a new lock-down for the second wave of the pandemic and mostly keeping isolated celebrating silvester's birthday alone in a cafe in den bosch hearing some music there before all cafes got closed"
