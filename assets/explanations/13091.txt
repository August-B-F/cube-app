"films shot partially with my old camera while still in italy rediscovering the beautiful city of mantua and later coming back to sweden and trying and finding a smart phone with a nice camera so switching to that one to make all my equipment more compact and this time having fun exploring and filming new public spaces particularly discovered while walking around stockholm like to the small show i had up north and filming with a broader angle and with a crisper image than the camera before thus also having to be careful not to film people in front of me especially acquaintances"
