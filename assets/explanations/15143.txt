"still a month building the metal workshop in my girlfriend's backyard and trying to protect myself from inhaling the dust of the cement bricks i reused to make the pavement till at last giving up the idea of cutting metal alone and trying to order it cut instead also for health concerns then getting back to a clean air and even mounting an fume aspirator in the shed and using it to cut the metal bars i have left beside that breathing the nice cold air trying to go out despite the snow and the kids feeling uncomfortable of the freezing temperatures only occasionally encountering some traffic with cars getting stuck in the snow"
