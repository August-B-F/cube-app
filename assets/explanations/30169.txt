"lecturing early in the morning outside my mountain apartment so as not to wake up my kids and giving an account of the progress made with the installation building it with the great help of my oldest son discussing how he has managed to gain a lot of manual skills unlike all the young volunteers willing to help with the project but being completely incapable to do even the smallest of tasks even on a computer and blaming this lack of manual skills on education also discussing in this lecture the on-going fuss with local hunters also incapable of doing anything themselves like the poor one hunting above the museum always asking favours to his many friends and the rich one on the side of the museum paying others to do the cutting trees and grass and turning the cottage into a luxury dwelling for him and in this respect showing the way to be in nature autonomous and able to conduct all the necessary tasks without all the political apparatus of the medieval like cities below the mountains and in this respect also discussing how i take no side in the fight between the traditionalists and the more progressive activists but describing an event in which i ripped the flag off a stand of the sovranist nationalist party"
