"feeling rather happy throughout this period of time being much engaged with social activities like a student conference in berlin where i also on the other hand started feeling rather upset about people in general but finally and most unexpectedly falling in love with myrthe in the very last day a few hours before my departure back to sweden and then being much engaged with her in our emotional affair and feeling rather hopeful for that with few moment of sadness and being most happy when being at my parents in italy although their mentality is rather oppressive but this looking forward the meeting of my love in the netherlands where we had a fantastic time and the happiness carried on until back in sweden i felt a bit sad but then got loaded again with myrthe's emails and being with my son august"
