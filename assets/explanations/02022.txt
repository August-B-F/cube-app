"getting quite some dreams about my stepfather in all possible circumstances but not so much about my mother or just with her and him together and also dreaming a bit about my son but no longer of his mother and generally having not so many dreams as before about traveling and commuting often having dreams about my art students or about art exhibits and at times having still these more imaginative dreams as if i was watching a movie"
