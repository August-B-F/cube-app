"a good amount of films shot in public spaces first of all in golden italy around the iseo lake while attempting to find a land to buy there and then back to gray sweden finding otherwise a nice weather on the west coast and film much there to later go back to the east coast and make some filming of public spaces making small excursions with august and also going back to his grandparents' city in uppsala and visiting the nice viking burial ground there to then drive away from sweden with myrthe and ending up visiting some interesting places like bremen in germany and later zwolle in the netherlands and there also extensively exploring den haag for the first time finding quite dreadful public spaces there to then explore the more gracious ones in delft"
