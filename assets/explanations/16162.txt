"the spring at last coming with a few days to begin with quite promising but then once again some cold days with some rain and often too much wind to appreciate the weather but at last also a very sunny weekend taking the kids on a wild beach along the waal river followed by some gray and crappy weather with in the very end almost summer temperatures taking the kids to the dutch sea across the dunes and feeling almost in a desert having to put sun lotion especially on silvester's white skin and at last taking shelter in a small forest later also biking with the kids wearing shorts but putting sun lotion not to get burnt as in the past"
