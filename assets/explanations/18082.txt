"a nice weather and low wind in the rich neighborhood of djursholm staying with my kid and being often outside before going to the netherlands and experiencing hard wind in my very big walk around the city of harnem and then again back in utrecht driving around to fetch old furniture with a wind almost blocking our van with a trailer attached and then little to no wind during my days spent doing brickwork outside and more wind going to meet hanneke in amsterdam and later in breda at one of myrthe's uncles funeral"
