"living like in a limbo now losing and gaining hope about realizing my project becoming now my faith and losing some determination as well as now getting stimulated to reflect certain thoughts that stuck on my mind reading nietzsche but beside only experiencing reality as such and not even growing indignant of being completely isolated and living in total social indifference and recording some thoughts with livia asleep in my chest and only whispering them and not really thinking them so much through afraid of waking her up"
