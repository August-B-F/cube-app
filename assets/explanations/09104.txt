"thoughts recorded mostly walking up to my installation alone and reflecting on my peace of mind after having sacrificed so much resources to build it and being blocked by the hunters and feeling content however with just stowing all the data within the cube structure also reflecting on my italian family and their meanness and also reflecting at times of plutarch's moral writings after finishing to read them yet at times being out of breath walking up the valley and also feeling afraid of the hunters"
