"another month going first from a rather cold and wet winter weather in stockholm to the warmer dutch weather where i anyway experienced a bit of snow but still was able to even go out by bike and then finally keeping a whole week renovating in the mountains and feeling a very nice temperature getting quite hot in the afternoon and then cold again at night with several beautiful days unlike the gray days at my return to the netherlands with one last very bright day"
