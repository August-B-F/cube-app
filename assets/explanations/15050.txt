"a month spent quite a lot outside biking and inhaling some occasional traffic going on big road south of my place to reach the open country but particularly inhaling a lot of the dust from all the gravel placed on the road in the winter and a few times also smelling the iron of the factories nearby but other than than that inhaling fresh air in utrecht despite the traffic found in the outskirt when biking with myrthe and the usual smell of the airplane gasoline when traveling"
