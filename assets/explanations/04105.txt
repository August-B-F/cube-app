"a period feeling not so happy particularly with my mountain neighbour's daughter coming to visit and requiring a lot of attention and simply making me in doubt of moving to italy and later also getting affected by livia walking up in the night but also letting me sleep some nights and feeling a bit better also finding joy in my work and realizing i can start building the cathedral in pieces here in holland"
