"recording my thoughts while in southern india walking alone on the beach and meditating about the spirituality there but also the very tough civilization breaking in and later recording in tiruvannamalai walking around and up the holy mountain whenever i was not with davide and at last coming back to europe and doing most of my recordings while in the netherlands taking advantage of some sunny days to walk alone by the river and record my thoughts there"
