"an young british italian met after a fantastic walk in the english countryside waiting for the bus to take me back to warwick and an angry british scholar met there who anyway liked my work and wanted to hear more about it before traveling to italy and staying with my parents in my natiove highland and photographing his friends and and their daughter working as a financial advisor in africa but also a venetian rich lady and her lover who i later came to despise really much and lastly an old man helping in a mountain shelter of a friend who was persuaded by my stepfather to cook for us even though his wife died"
