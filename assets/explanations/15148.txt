"a first period in the netherlands no longer welding and only doing some mosaics protecting myself fairly okay from the cement and also talking rather long walks going even from delft all the way into rotterdam and breathing some pollution making it later fairly okay to italy without much pollution and the roads empty due to the pandemic still hitting europe at last making it to the wild mountains and there using the trimmer to cut grass breathing some gases and later welding the project museum textures in larger panels in a neighbour garage doing pretty good with my new helmet but at last getting a cold with all the air constantly flowing down my head"
