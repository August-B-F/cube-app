"left alone in boston with my old highschool friend alessandro quitting my job at mit university and going for a lat holiday with him making it to new york city exploring the most touristic side of it and then all the way to montreal meeting for the last time my father there walking together around the town with him most nervous about the sort of gay pride going on there but also visiting more historical sites and the park above saint urban where i also lived as a kid and then leaving my father for good and making it to toronto being quite impressed about the modern architecture and infrastructure there but mostly enjoying the beautiful and crystal clear ontario lake before driving down to the niagara falls still feeling much impressed about the rich canada especially in comparison with a most run down united states after checking the emptied out and trashed buffalo city with still the glamour of a once wealthy town and then stopping at lakes in the near of white people gated communities before reaching albany finding there less of a deprived state probably due to all the governmental institutions there and also some sort of music festival"
