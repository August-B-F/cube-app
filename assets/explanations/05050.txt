"in the netherlands strolling with myrthe around utrecht but also visiting the city of antwerp and doing quite some walking with her there to then go to england and feeling like escaping the conference sedentary environment going for a major walk very early morning managing to reach the city of coventry from the warwick campus and later walking in an afternoon through the magnificent english landscape and forest reaching the side of the precious town of kingsworth till finally spending a short weekend with myrthe and her relative taking minor walks in the countryside after major bike rides and walking again with august and her in the sea side of lignano through the modern tourist center and much on the beach even at night with the full moon"
