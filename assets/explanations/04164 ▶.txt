"feeling at first quite happy showing students the project museum in italy and then making it back to holland happy at first with the children and with the nice weather there but then having both of them falling sick and the weather also getting quite bad feeling rather frustrated and stuck but slowly getting able to set up the production of the project museum tags and also doing some progress outside building the garden path and getting quite good again being able to have some days just working on my project and taking long walk like a solitary one in breda while myrthe visited her parents with the kids"
