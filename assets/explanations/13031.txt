"again spending much time with my son with his mother always stuck to her computer and taking him out mostly to many of the nice playgrounds promoted by the obama administration before making it to new york city together staying at my old friend brian in brooklin and walking extensively through manhattan to central park but also back across the two southern bridges into brooklin making it there to the orthodox jew quarter and to the parks but also with brian reaching the quite decadent coney island before returning to boston and still with my son making it to much of the open air locations exploring the whole boston area"
