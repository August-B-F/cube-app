"walking while in italy still with the kids unable to go very far yet being quite regular going up and down the nearby mountain roads and also walking to my installation despite the works being still blocked there and walking in the town of schio mostly shopping for the mountains as well taking longer walks with the kids behind the space where their mom worked in the middle of a nice countryside and only in one occasion taking a longer walk up the pasubio mountain with the french and american girls coming to film my installation"
