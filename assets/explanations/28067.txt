"in berlin filming myself recording the songs i heard while in public places waiting for myrthe to arrive and later writing in my journal somewhere in the room we rented from a transvestite living in the suburbs and filming myself filming public places before also filming some romance and then at a restaurant filming myself drawing the long walk we just accomplished and then back in our room filming my experience of the rise of a beautiful autumn day despite being quite much in a crisis with my swedish supervisor and the conservative environment there"
