"in stockholm mostly breathing the air of the truck factory with the wind blowing towards my apartment having the windows open still because of the heat and also the buses driving in the road below and generally all the traffic found going by bike but mostly being in the city center or traveling to myrthe in the netherlands and breathing the airplane fuel prior taking off to get much nicer air in maastricht and during our bike rides in belgium"
