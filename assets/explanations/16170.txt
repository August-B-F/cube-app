"still a way too hot autumn especially in the middle of the day but soon experiencing quite some change of weather with at last a lot of rain and wind in our dutch village still venturing out with my kids before making it to a very hot and warm provence with very cold nights but a very clear sky and a strong sun during the day almost feeling like we need sun cream despite the late season"
