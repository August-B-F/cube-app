"at first feeling quite charged about speaking out having been left once again without any money after paying off a custom broker to deliver me the metal i needed for the building of my museum but later having less opportunities to go out and record my thoughts with the weather getting quite bad and the wind not really allowing me to speak and at last getting to much in welding the metal textures of the museum and feeling a bit burnt and unable to think as fresh as before also with a rather intoxicated throat despite all the attempts to protect me from the welding fumes"
