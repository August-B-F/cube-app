"films of public spaces shot almost entirely in venice looking for an apartment and mostly hitting the east of the city exploring both castello and sant'elena and finally opting for one in the small island of san pietro and going there several times taking long walks across the city to reach it and filming the many squares with many tourists but also very empty spots of the city and even the lido going there with my parents at easter feeling much in love with the sea and briefly also being in the inland like in vicenza filming very little there"
