"feeling happy back in the sunny mountains but also sad about having to soon detach from it and frustrated not being able to do any work there during the christmas holiday but then getting help from myrthe and jacek cutting down some trees and later going to cold sweden feeling captivated and without august who skipped missing me for an evening but then happy spending a nice sunday with him walking in the frozen winter landscape and getting quite excited about the possibility to get more fields next to my future cathedral and being proposed more work at the university in sweden but also feeling quite frustrated back in the netherlands and slowly getting to like life there taking lonely walks and focusing on my work"
