"making it back from the open french landscapes in a most congested and overpopulate netherlands experiencing quite some traffic every time we made it to the outskirts of our village and later traveling smoothly to our small farm in the italian alps and there welding a shed with scrap metal using the mask with the respirator but still inhaling some fumes possibly because i did not push the mask close enough to my face and also experiencing quite some traffic meeting my old friend francesco in vicenza and while in schio with the family eating a pizza in an immigrant neighborhood but beside that breathing the fresh mountain air especially after much rain not so bothered about at times using the trimmer to cut grass"
