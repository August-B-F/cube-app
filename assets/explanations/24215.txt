"a month getting a bit bored and restless of our life in the netherlands really longing for the wilderness of the alps and at last traveling alone with the children across germany getting enchanted with my ancestors land bavaria and spending some beautiful days there before crossing the alps and reaching the a heatwave stroke italy having quite some nice days with the children both in our small mountain village but also exploring the already golden fields down below managing as well to do some work with the help of an half sicilian girl coming to help a few hours every morning"
