"a period spent mostly indoor after the summer outside in the sunny mountains and feeling energetic to concentrate on my work and of preparing the house happy to know we will get a small girl and happy to prepare for my presentation of my cathedral to the schio municipality although at times feeling bad about my back being stiff and the continuous bad weather making it hard to walk or bike"
