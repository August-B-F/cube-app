"visiting august in sweden and picking mushrooms in what is left of his forest after his grandfather got most of it clear cut and then beginning to prepare a rendering of the cathedral to be built in italy and also filming myself observing clouds and then filming the concert of one of my neapolitan friends franco later also filming myself photographing the objects used to start renovating the attic of our dutch house so as to give up the study to our little daughter and even getting an augmented reality application to show to the italian authorities to allow me to build the cathedral"
