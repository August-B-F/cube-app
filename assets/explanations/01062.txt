"a very cold month with much commuting to do from uppsala to stockholm teaching electronics at the art academy there and feel most depressed due to the lack of sleep yet using quite some objects also at home doing a lot of cooking and baking bread also with august after school lighting fire in the snow and grilling our usual sausages while at work mostly getting food from the academy buffet always however having to deal with snow but either way always using the bike to go to the station and never now making to the countryside feeling most against my father-in-law there so much a subordinate of the swedish lame society"
