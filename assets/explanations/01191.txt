"a month fully spent in the netherlands taking care of my children and having not so much extra time to take care of my project beside updating regularly and thinking a lot about how to create the tags of my tebah making several prototypes with new tools and also traveling with the whole family to several places around the netherlands to get material to experiment and combining these trips with small excursions often resulting in very little objects used particularly carrying silvester in the carrier bag and just walking with him unable to do so much more"
