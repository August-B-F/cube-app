"in the old german prussia, now russian kaliningrad doing a workshop and walking quite a lot but really find quite little on the sidewalk aside for the city center and at night before the matrioska (old russian women with a handkerchief on their head) goes out and sweep the sidewalks, from prussia then going for a week to my native highland in the alps and picking a bit of trash in the touristic village to then return to sweden in our new apartment in a well-off island with really no much trash aside for the one i pick going to visit jacek in the center of town"
