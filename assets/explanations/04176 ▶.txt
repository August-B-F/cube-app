"still very much triggered about the writing of the anarcarkist manifesto spending a nice time in the mountains with the family but soon realizing how hard it is to make new installations there with a most middle class minded mentality feeling a time also frustrated about the rainy weather but getting quite a kick of energy with the sun and some walking with the children but then finding a most dreadful weather back in the netherlands getting me quite down soon however recovering my usual strength and happiness taking walks with myrthe and also the children especially after camping together in limburg and near dusseldorf"
