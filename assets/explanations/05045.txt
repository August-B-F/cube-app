"quite much walking alone exploring the neighborhood in my now solitary weekends without my kid but also with him going back to my previous discoveries crossing the bridge to the opposite coasts and also walking with him still across the botanic garden still frozen lake and over a small mountain where i used to take him many years ago and through a cemetery and roads but then finally walking quite a lot in berlin to because of a conference and rebelling to the idea of seating walking a long way from the hostel to the house of culture and to the city but also through the nice tiergarten despite the harsh winter conditions"
