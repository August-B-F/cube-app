"a month feeling happy at first to be able to have some time here and there to work hard on my project making it a prerogative to keep up with catching up with all its various instances and at times feeling a bit stuck in the routine of having to also take care of the daughter of our greek spanish friends later also getting to do quite a physical exercise beginning to make the floor of the garage lifting and mixing hundreds of concrete bags in the end however getting quite exhausted of all the work and trying to spend more nice time with the kids especially with the weather getting nicer"
