"much time spent exclusively with the kids taking them to playground and keeping them active despite the gray and often rainy winter weather and managing also to keep my head active getting ideas often related from our being together and the stories i tell them especially with animals but also getting some erotic ideas mostly in the evening feeling a bit frustrated having to start working only then preferring the morning work and mostly drawing the ideas in the afternoon with livia watching some tv and relaxing and wearing headphones myself not to be distracted later no longer able to use my stationary scanner due to a system update of my computer having to use my old portable one"
