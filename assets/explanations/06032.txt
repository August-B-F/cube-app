"running still in the gym despite again a back pain and also pain under the foot thus trying to run without shoes but still accomplishing good result as i have been very much willing to push out stress and work anger but also getting interrupted by the other international students with whom i have talked and lastly taking advantage of the warm winter to run outside and make a new track in the park where i do chinese gymnastics running twice perpendicularly to it to accomplish a lap on the grass rather than on the hard asphalt of the parking lot where i used to run in the neighborhood and also going there to run with august after the christmas break and being a bit stressed by him lastly to finish quickly"
