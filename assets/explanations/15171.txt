"breathing fresh air in the mountains but a rather polluted air when coming down to the northern italian plateau with no wind nor rain cleaning up the congested atmosphere of way too many cars and back in the mountains also doing some work out in the fields playing with the idea of one day build a cathedral of my project but at first experiencing a bit of traffic from the nearby road and then also from the machines i started using like my small chainsaw not really working on certain hard wood trees having to keep cutting quite some time to fall them and then using the trimmer to cut especially all the many trees on the path i made going up the project museum and on the way back in the netherlands finding not so much traffic and once in the netherlands not really moving so much only staying mostly home keeping the fireplace going and burning all the wood of the garden shed i have been demolishing at times smelling a bit of the fumes in the attic"
