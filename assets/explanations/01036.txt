"a month still commuting to gothenburg to teach there using not so many tools but still trying to cook with other students while in the university building and back in stockholm having a bit of a formal life going occasionally to swim but only later during the christmas break having really a more cheerful time in the countryside playing with little august but also doing renovation work and starting to prune the apple trees"
