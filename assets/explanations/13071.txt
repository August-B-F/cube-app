"in sweden still taking walks in the frozen landscape and filming as it was some sort of dutch landscape painting but less animated with fewer ice-skaters venturing out and on top of it finding some nice new panoramic parts of stockholm with little august to later go to a conference in berlin and escape whenever i could to go our and film the city but ultimately falling in love with the tier garden landscape and a strip of the city by the river which i often crossed on my way to the conference hall"
