"quite a lot of walking with the starting of a nice spring combined from the beginning with a lot of biking to small forests that i explored on foot or to a camping site down in jarna with august but also taking a few walks in the peaceful karlstad where i had a course and then in vicenza where i visited my parents and particularly enjoyed wandering on the hills of monteviale where i once was painting for a whole summer walking also with francesco to the monte berico sanctuary after a little run but walking also quite a lot back in sodertalje with august going all the way across town and to the north part which i have never explored but only to end up to a mall with a print shop to later find a nice way back through the cemetery and the forest and also walking in stockholm with myrthe and asmund enjoying the nice spring weather and ending up in beautiful djursholm"
