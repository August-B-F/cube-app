"a quiet clean month aside from being in italian cities like first walking in udine and then biking to the rather big sea side resort of bibbione meeting all the tourist traffic but particularly getting a lot of traffic pollution driving to the ugly industrial area of the city of padua where my uncle has a little warehouse and otherwise inhaling clean air while at the sea side and not so much bad air traveling by airplane back to sweden where however i still smell the traffic outside while leaving the windows open because of the heat"
