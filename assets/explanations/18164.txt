"a summer period in italy with quite a heat wave but luckily some wind bringing some relief particularly in venice where i spent some time renovating our apartment and later in the netherlands finding quite a bad weather and always some wind but never too much except one day biking out with the kids having some troubles to bike back and in the last part of this period finding a great weather with some days of no wind perfect for biking and doing excursions with the whole family"
