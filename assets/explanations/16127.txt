"quite a nice autumn in the netherlands with some days of very blue sky and then going to italy to find a much warmer temperature but experiencing the first cold night in the mountains with a strong wind and a storm bringing snow to the tops and then again the heat beside one gloomy day spent in venice with my parents and back in holland still finding a quiet sunny autumn"
