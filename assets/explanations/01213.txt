"a very sunny beginning of the fall trying to spend as much time out with my kids in turn not using so many objects but the usual ones on the road like my phone and camera as well as the car keys and the credit card but either way managing somehow to still get some objects photographed mostly in the evening cooking and at times starting to dismantle the metal workshop outside feeling very hesitant to resume the production of my mosaic tiles"
