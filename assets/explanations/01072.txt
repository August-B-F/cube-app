"with my wife still furious at me wanting for my life project to stop and possibly being very much in a cultural shock feeling rather alienated by chinese society still keeping up with my project actually feeling rather in harmony with china despite really hating the pollution and the lack of green spaces around our neighborhood nonetheless trying to spend time with my son bringing him around the metropolis especially after school and discovering new places like the urumqi neighborhood getting some arab decorated bread there and bubble tea trying out many things for the first time also at the cheap restaurants there but nonetheless also cooking myself and in the end beginning to teach a nice class of very talented chinese design students building interactive works with them but later going for a holiday with the family to malaysia and soon leaving the quite ugly city of kuala lumpur finding an idyllic spot in the small island of pangkor spending some nice days with the family there and even trying to explore alone the island but chased by wild dogs ending up on a damp surrounded by aggressive monkeys and also getting into quite some fights with the local youth driving their motorcycles way too close to my son"
