"a month working extremely hard to begin with to set up my installation with help of davide and even starting to wed the whole structure before been called off by the architect who feared along with the municipality some retaliation from the local hunters and the right wing supporting them and at last giving up the plan to keep on building and at first spending some time at my mother in vicenza to later reunite with my little daughter livia in mestre while her mother took her students to the venice biennale and mostly exploring the city despite the rain and at last making it back to the netherlands resuming my life there taking care of livia and working on my project but also doing some gardening and some biking"
