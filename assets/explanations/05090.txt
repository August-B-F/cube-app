"a month with still some walking despite most of the time spent renovating the barn in the alps and there taking a one day of break walking to the nice branksome cliff and taking more walks visiting my parents both in vicenza and later in venice walking very extensively and quite much improvising with myrthe and at last in sweden taking advantage of the nice blue sky to walk several times the old train road in djursholm taking me straight to the beach and walking both with jacek and later with august circumnavigating the rich neighborhood and at last going by foot all the way to the central station to catch the bus to the airport"
