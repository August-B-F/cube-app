"still quite some sun despite the autumn coming by and with august at school taking quite some excursion across the city mostly from the south west and to the center even making it over to kungsholm and then often into the posh vasastan visiting jacek and following up to his idea to collaborate together and back with august mostly in the afternoons venturing more into our fjord to the west getting closer to the malaren lake just opposite of where his viking ancestors came from and more in the weekends making it with him to sodermalm mostly to a nice and trashy playground by the tantolund park"
