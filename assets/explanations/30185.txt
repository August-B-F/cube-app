"discussing how i stood strong in the last period about realizing the staircase and the floors of the project museum in the alps after the italian authorities began to obstruct me only for populist reasons in the end convincing the architect to keep up our plan after he proposed an ugly solution using scaffolding and i tried to work with him to at least customize them to fit in the museum and later also comparing my operation out in the open using longer lasting materials with the fast culture i am now outsourcing building for artist celebrities very temporary exhibits that only last some months and are quickly thrown away only to keep on with the same ideological discussion at last also mentioning about the latter pandemic and how from the beginning of the project two decades ago life under the digital paradigm has become far more impossible"
