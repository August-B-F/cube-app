"walking quite a bit in stockholm with my new camera now easily making a lot of films of public spaces with a broader view than my previous type of camera and thus also having to pay attention not to film the people right around me but also achieving a deeper vanishing point and now filming also natural spaces while taking a long walk back to the city and during nice sunny days to then go to italy and film quite a lot there in my parents city of vicenza but also visiting padua with myrthe and particularly exploring intensively milan feeling also quite happy about the white balance and distant objects which where not well captured with the previous kind of camera"
