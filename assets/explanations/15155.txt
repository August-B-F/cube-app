"a month fully at work with only some healthy day off in the weekend trying to be out with my kids despite the bad winter weather and at work getting quite much of a toxic air not only from the wood dust i can tolerate but doing metal work cutting bars with an old saw trying not to breath the fumes of the oiled blade and also later welding doing my best to cover myself up and use the fume aspirator at last feeling quite fed up about all the smells but later resuming work with wood and feeling much better trying also to ventilate much more keeping the garage door open"
