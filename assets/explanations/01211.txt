"a month spent in the mountains working really hard to set up the textures of the project museum yet keeping on the same site and using the same objects so not really showing the amount of work with always very little photos at the end of the day until the work with the museum progressed and a distinction was possible between the inside and the outside of it rephotographing again the objects i used outside as soon as one or more objects where used inside and vice-versa and beside that also spending some days with myrthe and the kids taking walks and also in these days taking few photos and at last trying to wrap up with the museum and helping august to improve the terrain around and later struggling to put a layer of linseed oil all over it in the very end using many tools going to the venice apartment to renovate it after several years with the students making a mess during the pandemic"
