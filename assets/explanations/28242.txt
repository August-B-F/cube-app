"filming nice moments with myrthe and alone with the children listening and singing songs later receiving the long metal stripes to start producing the project museum textures and transporting them to the garden to cut them and weld them together making an incredible effort also with the kids around later also working on the manual of the project and getting back to welding the first textures despite the neighbours beginning to get quite upset about it filming later some biking with the children on the other side of the dike and little livia beginning to go with her scooter later having to start arranging the building of a garden shed so as not to upset the neighbours all together when welding the project museum textures"
