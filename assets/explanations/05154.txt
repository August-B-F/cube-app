"a month in the netherlands with not the best weather and also stopping the car to save some money being then confined in our dutch town walking a lot with the kids and trying to vary our excursion based on the limited options going to one or another park or to the river and also along the dike but never for too long with the kids getting tired and once also trying to walk with them down the river but at last having to carry them both back and only in one occasion going to utrecht with the family and walking across it"
