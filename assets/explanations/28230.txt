"with my new little family in the mountains checking out a beautiful sunset with a rainbow and then recording my thoughts down the mountains walking down the mincio river and its summer vegetation and in mantua with myrthe's mother and her boyfriend listening to a band playing upon returning to the mountains perfecting the very nicely made new foundation of the project museum and then at last filming a nice afternoon spent with some hippy new friends at the vegetarian restaurant with live music and dance"
