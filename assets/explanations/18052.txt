"not too much wind from the beginning being with august in the netherlands experiencing much wind while walking with him in a forest of breda and then almost no wind back in sweden but on my way back to the netherlands where again the wind was not too strong although a lot of subtle changes were felt in rotterdam while walking by the water and a bit stronger walking out of myrthe attic to do some tai-chi by the river yet at last going back to sweden finding almost no wind but in the very end experiencing it quite strongly up on a cliff with august where it was impossible to light any proper fire"
