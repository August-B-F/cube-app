"in the middle of the spring now finishing off to restore the rotten wall under the window of august's future bedroom in the countryside and also renovating the actual window and doing quite a lot of cultivating in my vegetable garden but also planting some fruit trees like a plum tree with august's placenta underneath it and also spending quite some time with the little boy putting him to sleep with the pacifier but also playing a small silver bell to him and using the cream for his butt before taking some small journeys together in our van to his mother's friends in stockholm and later to the master program where i teach in gothenburg always using fewer objects in the days i commute"
