"still singing to the kids and hearing livia sing songs also learned while at school but also managing to take small trips together like to arnhem and utrecht and listening to the radio and the music being played in the city before the coming back of the pandemic keeping us all the time in our village with livia in the afternoon watching cartoons and hearing the same songs repeating quite often"
