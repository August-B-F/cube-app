"worrying a bit about my heart spending a lot of time welding the project museum textures and with too bad weather to do outdoor activities but trying whenever possible to walk fast taking both kids on the stroller after also letting them train quite a bit walking and also going during the evening for very fast walks and training my heart up the steps of the railway bridge to then also take the kids for bike rides and then alone biking with a gas tank in the kids trailer to get it replaced while our car was at the mechanic and rediscovering the pleasure of touring even though any small wind made it too hard to bike with the trailer"
