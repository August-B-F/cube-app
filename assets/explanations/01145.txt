"a month started high up in my field cleaning up to make space for the building to host my project using my motor-chain and doing small picnic with myrthe and then soon traveling to sweden keeping a whole week at august's place but mostly doing teaching and later going to culemborg working hard on my own project as well as being often outdoor using some sunny days to build up the bike shelter with the remaining bricks and building many wooden crates to place all my photo panels"
