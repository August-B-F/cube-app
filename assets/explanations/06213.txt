"working very hard transporting thousands of kilos of iron up to the project museum loading and downloading it and lifting it in place to construct the two floors inside in the end taking it quite easy and leaving for a holiday n the south of italy with my whole family suffering a great neck pain probably due to all the lifting particularly of the dozen of gratings i had to move from floor to floor and trying to recover the pain doing minor activities such as being in the water with my kids letting them jump up and down the waves but also walk with them and explore many places in the abruzzo"
