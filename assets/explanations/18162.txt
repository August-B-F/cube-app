"spending most of this period welding the textures on the project museum in the alps and experiencing often the same pattern with the wind very calm early in the morning and late in the afternoon but quite troublesome in the middle of the day making it hard to weld but also quite scary to stand on the very high ladder and only taking a small break going with the kids to the seaside at my mother's and also there finding the sea always agitated with often quite some wind blowing making the heat more tolerable and back in the mountains experiencing a more erratic weather with sudden strong winds and later none at all and using these last days to work hard on the last floor of the museum"
