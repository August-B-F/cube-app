"still in karlstad trying to stick out from the frigid academic environment there and attending a classical music concert and back in my room filming me writing my dreams and also drawing while still at karlstad university before making to italy and there spending some time with my young niece and recording the wind while at fimon lake with her and later recording songs while eating with her parents"
