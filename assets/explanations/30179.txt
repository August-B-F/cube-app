"giving an update about a small exhibition i had in our dutch village along with a drag queen and a quite creative lady being somewhat us three the excluded local artists of an art event but getting good feedback and finding back the will to keep up with my cube idea and the making of the mosaic tiles in a lighter fashion using epoxy glue but still keeping up the labour intensive aspect and later discussing the twelve works we decided along with my volunteer assistant jacolinde to show to the public on the ground floor and decide to include the recording of thoughts to give it more of an edge against the middle class censorship finally in the lecture reflecting of my reading about herzen's memoir and seeing the region where the project museum is now placed as the siberia of the venice republic where entire families where put in exile but also reflecting about the culture that the very autocracy of the tsar in russia generated"
